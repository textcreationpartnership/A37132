            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>When our Saviour was on the earth, ſome then asked him theſe two queſtions;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The firſt is in</hi> Luke 13.23. Then ſaid one unto him, Lord, Are there few that be ſaved? <hi>This was the firſt queſtion. Now mark well the anſwer:</hi> And he ſaid unto them, Strive to enter in at the ſtrait gate: for many, I ſay unto you, will ſeek to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in, but ſhall not be able.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ſecond is in</hi> Luke 18.18. And a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Ruler asked him, ſaying, Good Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
<pb facs="tcp:59933:3"/> What ſhall I do to inherit eternal life? <hi>Now to this queſtion, our Lord Jeſus gave this anſwer;</hi> And Jeſus ſaid unto him, Why calleſt thou me good? none is good ſave one, that is God. Thou knoweſt the Commandments, Do not commit adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Do not kill. Do not ſteal. Do not bear falſe witneſs. Honour thy Father and thy Mother. And he ſaid, All theſe have I kept from my youth up. Now when Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus heard theſe things, he ſaid unto him, Yet lackeſt thou one thing: Sell all that thou haſt, and diſtribute to the poor, and thou ſhalt have treaſure in Heaven, and come, follow me. And when he heard this, he was very ſorrowful, for he was very rich.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theſe Anſwers proceeded out of the mouth of Wiſdom: He that</hi> ſpake as never man ſpake, <hi>ſaid to the firſt,</hi> Strive to enter in at the ſtrait gate. <hi>And to the ſecond he ſaid,</hi> Keep the Commandments of God: <hi>do not break them, but duly obſerve them.</hi> And what he ſaid unto one, he ſaith unto all, <hi>Mark</hi> 13.37. For many, I ſay unto you, will ſeek to enter in, but ſhall not be able, <hi>This word ſhould ſtrike terrour into the hearts of men, and awaken their ſleepy Conſciences.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt; They that ſeek when it is too late: None ſhall be able to enter in at the ſtrait gate,
<pb facs="tcp:59933:3"/> and narrow way which leadeth unto life with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtriving; and this ſtriving muſt be before the Maſter of the houſe be riſen up.</hi> When once the Maſter of the houſe is riſen up, and hath ſhut to the door, and ye begin to ſtand without, and to knock at the door, ſaying, Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he ſhall anſwer and ſay unto you, I know you not whence you are: then ſhall ye begin to ſay, We have eaten, and drank in thy preſence, and thou haſt taught in our ſtreets. But he ſhall ſay, I tell you, I know you not whence ye are; depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity. <hi>The reaſon of this is here very plain; they were workers of iniquity, and theſe workers of iniquity did not ſeek to enter in till it was too late. When men live without God in the world; without the fear and knowledge of God, and have no ſence of his love and mercy to them: When men wallow in the filth and mire of ſin, being abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable and diſobedient, and make light of Chriſt Jeſus, and of all the means of grace, till ſickneſs overtakes them, and the terrours of death takes hold on them. And when they find that all hopes of life and recovery is taken from them, that they muſt die; then they will ſeek, and cry unto the Lord, and deſire others to pray for them. But what hath the Lord ſpoken concerning this ſort of ſeekers, theſe late
<pb facs="tcp:59933:4"/> ſeekers? ſee</hi> Prov. 1.24. Becauſe I have called, and ye refuſed, I have ſtretched out my hand, and no man regarded it; but ye have ſet at nought all my counſel, and would none of my reproof: I alſo will laugh at your calamity, I will mock when your fear cometh; when your fear cometh as deſolation, and your deſtruction cometh as a whirlwind; when diſtreſs and anguiſh cometh upon you; then ſhall they call upon me, but I will not anſwer; they ſhall ſeek me early, but they ſhall not find me. <hi>Seeking without ſtriving will not do, and this ſtriving muſt be with the whole heart, before that midnight cry comes.</hi> And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold the Bridegroom cometh, go ye out to meet him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.6.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>O Reader! Seek the Lord while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near. He now waits that he may be gracious, and ſtands at the door of thy heart, and knocks for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance,</hi> Rev. 3.20. <hi>O hear his voice, and let him into thy ſoul, that it may become</hi> an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation of God through the Spirit, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.22.</p>

Do they adorn the Goſpel, and their Profeſſion, by their good examples, and
<pb facs="tcp:59933:6"/> heavenly converſations? Is there to be found in them an excellent ſpirit, a ſpirit of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and patience, a ſpirit of faith and prayer, a ſpirit of love and charity, a ſpirit of wiſdom and underſtanding, a ſpirit of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and purity? And are they</hi> filled with the fruits of the ſpirit, which is, love, joy, peace, long-ſuffering, gentleneſs, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, faith, meekneſs, temperance: againſt ſuch there is no law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22, 23. <hi>Are theſe the Marks and Characters of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors now-a-day? No, no, it is not thus with them; their ſins teſtifie againſt them; multitudes of them are Chriſtians without a Croſs, and Saints without Sanctification; they are Virgins without Oyl in their Lamps; they are gueſts at the Table of the Lord without wedding garments; they are Church-members without fellowſhip with the Father and his Son Chriſt Jeſus; they are Profeſſors of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, but without the power; they have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from things, but not from ſin. Ah! the World ſaith this of Profeſſors; they are as proud and as vain as others; they are as covetous and as earthly-minded as others; they are as hard-hearted and as unmerciful to one another as others; they are as falſe and as deceitful as others; they are as looſe and lukewarm as others; let it be then conſidered whether the World hath not juſt cauſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
<pb facs="tcp:59933:6"/> Profeſſors; and if the World condemn them, and their own hearts too, will not God condemn them, after they have lain under the Rack of their own Conſciences here, and to all thoſe miſeries hereafter, which will be the portion of hypocrites.</hi> For many, I ſay unto you, will ſeek to enter in, but ſhall not be able. <hi>O Reader! ſtrive thou to enter in at the ſtrait gate, and into the narrow way which leadeth unto life.</hi>

            <p>If thou ſeekeſt her as for ſilver, and ſearcheſt for her as for hid treaſures: then ſhalt thou underſtand the fear of the Lord, and find the knowledge of God, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.4, 5. <hi>Men will dig deep for hidden treaſures; men will go far to ſeek for ſilver; they will break their peace, and their reſt too, to gain riches; they will labour day and night, to lay up goods for a few years; if they can treaſure up wealth, they will do it, though they treaſure up wrath with it; if they can make themſelves great in this World, they will do it, though they make themſelves miſerable for it in the next World for ever; if they can climb up high, they will, though they fall into the bottomleſs Pit; if they can gain the World, they will, though they loſe their own ſouls: As they ſtrive to be great, do thou ſtrive to be good; and as they ſtrive to be rich in world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wealth, do thou ſtrive to be rich towards
<pb facs="tcp:59933:7"/> God in all heavenly graces; and if thou haſt taken many ſteps towards hell and damnation, let me now prevail with thee to take a few ſteps towards heaven.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>The firſt is Conſideration: Conſider well what thou haſt been doing, and whither thou art going; whoſe thou art, and to whom thou doſt belong, and what will become of thee to all eternity. O Reader! no Croſs, no Crown: no grace, no glory: no holineſs, no happineſs: no regeneration, no ſalvation: and without ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord,</hi> Heb. 12.14.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ſecond ſtep is Examination: Examine thy ſelf; turn into thy ſelf, that thou maiſt throughly underſtand thy own ſtate; and when thou haſt examined matters carefully, if thou findeſt thy ſtate to be bad, then flie unto the Lord God by prayer and ſupplication, by faith and repentance, and thou wilt find that the arms of his mercy are open to receive thee. The Lord invites thee to come to him in the ſofteſt and moſt melting language that can be imagined.</hi> Come now and let us rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon together, ſaith the Lord; though your ſins be as Scarlet, they ſhall be as white as Snow; though they be red like Crimſon, they ſhall be as Wooll, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.18. <hi>And if thou findeſt thy ſtate to be good, that thou art a new creature, and born again, and haſt taſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed how good the Lord is, that he hath given
<pb facs="tcp:59933:7"/> thee a new heart, and a new underſtanding, and a new will, and a new nature, and that this hath changed thy life: Now I ſay, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on examination of thy ſelf, if thou findeſt that Chriſt Jeſus is in thee, then thou haſt cauſe to rejoyce; and if Chriſt Jeſus be in thee, then theſe four things will be in thee.</hi>

The ſad effects of this is too often ſeen and heard at the place of execution of Malefactors, who do there lament their miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ends, and deſire that all others may take warning by them, and not to keep lewd and wicked company, as they had done, which had led them into all wickedneſs, and had brought them to that ſhameful end; which ſhews
<pb facs="tcp:59933:8"/> it ſelf in the ſad looks they then put on, and the ſorrowful words they then ſpeak, and doleful crys they then make. O! refrain from lewd men and women, and from every evil way. The keeping of bad company hath brought ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men to ſhame, and poverty, to diſgrace, and to everlaſting miſery. O! flie from this as from a Lion; as from people that have plague-ſores upon them; as from poiſon that is ſet before thee in a diſh.</hi> And with many other words did he teſtifie and exhort, ſaying, Keep your ſelves from this, unto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward generation, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.40.

And have no fellowſhip with the unfruitful works of darkneſs, but rather reprove them, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.11. <hi>Let them be thy companions that fear the Lord, and keep his Commandments, and walk in the way of truth and righteouſneſs.

            <p>
               <hi>The fifth ſtep; Hear and hearken carefully to the voice of God that ſpeaketh to thee, and in thee. This voice is from Heaven, and it ſpeaketh peace and good will to men on Earth.
<pb facs="tcp:59933:9"/> Every man hath in him a Teacher, and this Teacher is from God.</hi> The ſpirit of man is the Candle of the Lord, ſearching all the inward parts of the belly, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.27. Say not in thine heart, Who ſhall aſcend into Heaven (that is, to bring Chriſt down from above?) or who ſhall deſcend into the deep; (that is, to bring up Chriſt again from the dead?) But what ſaith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith which we preach, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.6, 7, 8. Which ſhew the work of the Law written in their hearts, their conſcience alſo bearing witneſs, and their thoughts the mean while accuſing, or elſe excuſing one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.15. God hath ſhewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do juſtly and to love mercy, and to walk humbly, with thy God, <hi>Micah</hi> 6.8. <hi>And if a man continueth in well-doing, he hath peace, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt; but if he do that which is evil, then his Conſcience accuſeth him, and reproacheth him. And if he continue in it, then Conſcience condemns him, and lays him under condemnation, and will be a witneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things.</hi> Beloved, if our heart condemn

               <hi>The ſixth ſtep; Imploy thy thoughts, ſtrength and time, to make thy Calling and Election ſure.</hi> Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your Calling and Election ſure: For if ye do theſe things, ye ſhall never fall, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my beloved brethren, be ye ſtedfaſt, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, foraſmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.58. <hi>Heaven is won or loſt on Earth. There are treaſures of grace in Chriſt Jeſus, and this grace hath appeared to all men, and this grace is ſufficient, it is the grace of God; O ſtrive to gain this grace, that it may give thee a title to the heavenly glory. This grace is ſo excellent, that</hi> it teacheth men, that denying all ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, they ſhould live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in this preſent world, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11, 12. <hi>Now if thou wilt but take theſe ſteps towards Heaven, then thou wilt be bleſſed in life, and happy at death, and glorious after death. The
<pb facs="tcp:59933:10"/> principal deſign of this ſmall Treatiſe, is to comfort the people of God, the ſubject whereof is exceeding weighty, and of great uſe to all that deſire to know the truth, as it is in Jeſus.</hi>

            <p>Thirdly, Of the time here ſpoken of, that will be all the days of their lives: Firſt <hi>being delivered out of the hands of their Enemies,</hi> then comes <hi>the ſerving of God without fear, in holineſs and righteouſneſs all the days of their lives.</hi>

            <p>Now, whereſoever God opens a door of Goſpel-light, grace, and liberty, there the Devil ſtirs up many adverſaries and enemies, and fills them with wrath and rage againſt the Goſpel, and the Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of it.

They ſaw the glory of Gods miracles in their paſſing over <hi>Jordan,</hi> the waters fled from them, they ſtood up in heaps, and were cut off, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 3.13. They then had Gods glorious preſence with them, and he made his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Arm bare for them, and the Angel of his preſence went before them. <hi>And it came to paſs when</hi> Joſhua <hi>was by</hi> Jericho, <hi>that he lift up his eyes, and looked, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, there ſtood a man over againſt him, with his Sword drawn in his hand: And</hi> Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua <hi>went unto him, and ſaid unto him, Art thou for us, or for our adverſaries?

By this you may ſee they entered into the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> with glory and triumph, with joy and gladneſs.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Conſider of the time and manner that theſe <hi>Jews</hi> were taken Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
<pb facs="tcp:59933:16"/> and carried away out of their own Land. <hi>And there came up</hi> Shalmaneſer <hi>King of</hi> Aſſyria, <hi>and he took</hi> Samaria, <hi>and carried away</hi> Iſrael <hi>into</hi> Aſſyria, <hi>and placed them in</hi> Halah, <hi>and in</hi> Habor, <hi>by the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of</hi> Gazon, <hi>and in the Cities of the</hi> Medes, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 17.6. <hi>And the Lord rejected all the Seed of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and afflicted them, and delivered them into the hand of ſpoilers, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he had caſt them out of his ſight,</hi> verſe 20. <hi>Until the Lord removed</hi> Iſrael <hi>out of his ſight, as he had ſaid by all his ſervants the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets: So was</hi> Iſrael <hi>carried away out of their own Land to</hi> Aſſyria, <hi>unto this day,</hi> verſe 23. They were carried away with ſhame and reproach. God was not with them, but againſt them, and was become their Enemy, becauſe they did ſecretly thoſe things that were not right againſt the Lord their God, and they built them high places in all their Cities, from the Tower of the Watchmen to the Fenced City, and they ſerved Idols, whereof the Lord had ſaid unto them, Ye ſhall not do this thing. And they left all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of the Lord their God, and made them molten Images, even two Calves; and made a Grove, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped all the Hoſt of Heaven, and ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Baal.</hi> And they cauſed their Sons and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59933:16"/> their Daughters to paſs through the fire, and uſed Divination, and Inchantments; and ſold themſelves to do evil in the ſight of the Lord, to provoke him to anger. Therefore the Lord was very angry with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and removed them out of his ſight, that there was none left but the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> only. By this a man may ſee the evil of ſin: It was ſin that turned Angels into Devils, and their Heaven into a Hell; it was ſin that turned <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> out of Paradiſe; it was ſin that turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Cities of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> into Flames and Aſhes; and it was ſin that turned <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Canaan,</hi> that good Land that flowed with Milk and Honey.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Conſider how long theſe <hi>Jews</hi> have been hid and concealed from all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther people on the face of the Earth, that were carried away by <hi>Shalmaneſer</hi> King of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> ſo long ago, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 17.6. No Hiſtory can ſhew where they are, in what Land or N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tion. No Travellers can tell us, that go from Nation to Nation, and from Kingdom to Kingdom, to Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys that are afar off, even to the utmoſt parts of the Earth, what is become of that people, that are uſually called the Ten Tribes. I have often asked the <hi>Jews</hi> that live amongſt us, this queſtion, whether
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59933:17"/> they have heard of them, or did know in what part of the World they were, their anſwer to me was, That God Almighty had hid, and concealed them in ſome part of the Earth or other, but they did not know where, but they did verily believe, that God would ſome time or other bring them forth in the eyes of all the Nations, and all the ends of the Earth ſhall ſee the Salvation of the Lord. <hi>And he ſaid, Go thy way</hi> Daniel, <hi>for the words are cloſed up and ſealed till the time of the end,</hi> Dan. 12.9. <hi>And when the ſeven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write, and I heard a voice from Heaven, ſaying unto me, Seal up thoſe things which the ſeven thunders uttered, and write them not,</hi> Rev 10.4.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Conſider the reſtauration of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to their own Land; they ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to that Land which God gave them for an Inheritance. The Scriptures of truth do fully and clearly ſhew this. <hi>For the Lord will have mercy on</hi> Jacob, <hi>and will yet chuſe</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and ſet them in their own Land,</hi> Iſa. 14 1. <hi>But the Lord liveth, which brought up, and which led the Seed of the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael <hi>out of the North Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and from all Countreys whither I had driven them, and they ſhall dwell in their own Land,</hi> Jer. 23.8. <hi>For I will take you
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59933:17"/> from among the Heathen, and gather you out of all Countreys, and will bring you into your own Land,</hi> Ezek. 36.24. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God, Behold, I will take the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of</hi> Iſrael <hi>from among the Heathen whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be gone, and will gather them on every ſide, and bring them into their own Land,</hi> Ezek. 27.21. <hi>And at that time ſhall</hi> Michael <hi>ſtand up, the great Prince which ſtandeth for the Children of thy people, and there ſhall be a time of trouble, ſuch as never was ſince there was a Nation, even to that ſame time: And at that time thy people ſhall be delivered,</hi> Dan. 12.1. <hi>For behold, in thoſe days, and in that time when I ſhall bring again the Captivity of</hi> Judah <hi>and</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, <hi>I will gather all Nations, and will bring them down into the Valley of</hi> Jehoſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat, <hi>and will plead with them there for my people, and for my heritage</hi> Iſrael, <hi>whom they have ſcattered among the Nations, and parted their Land,</hi> Joel 3.1, 2. <hi>And I will bring again the Captivity of my people of</hi> Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, <hi>and they ſhall build the waſte Cities and inhabit them; and they ſhall plant Vineyards, and drink the Wine thereof: They ſhall alſo make Gardens, and eat the Fruit of them. And I will plant them upon their Land, and they ſhall no more be pulled up out of their Land which I have given them, ſaith the

            <p>Nine Prophets have declared this great truth, the Reſtauration of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and their teſtimony is true: God that ſcattered the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> will gather them, and bring them again into their own Land. <hi>How much more ſhall theſe, which be the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural branches, be graffed into their own Olive-tree?</hi> Rom. 11.24. <hi>For God is able to graff them in again,</hi> verſe 23.

            <p>I ſhall come now to the Chapter out of which my Text is taken, and I have taken theſe Prophets in my way, that by them I might light you along, and open a way to this great Prophecy, that I have here ſet before you, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.1. Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar <hi>in the ſecond year of his Reign dreamed Dreams, wherewith his Spirit was troubled, and his ſleep brake from him.</hi> God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty can trouble Great Perſons by ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little and ſmall things, as Dreams and Viſions, by thoughts that ariſe in their Hearts, and by their own Conſciences. King <hi>Saul</hi> when he ſaw a form of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing aſcending out of the Earth like <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:59933:20"/> he was ſore troubled, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28.20. A Hand-writing made Great <hi>Belſhazzer change his countenance, and his thoughts trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled him, ſo that the joints of his loins were looſed, and his knees ſmote one againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> Dan. 5.6. A Dream ſo troubled <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s Spirit, that his ſleep brake from him.</p>
            <p>Dan. 2.2. <hi>Then the King commanded to call the Magicians and Aſtrologers, and the Sorcerers, and the</hi> Chaldeans, <hi>for to ſhew the King his Dreams: ſo they came and ſtood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King,</hi> verſe 3. <hi>And the King ſaid unto them, I have dreamed a Dream, and my Spirit was troubled to know the Dream;</hi> but this was without ſucceſs, for they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered not the Kings deſires, becauſe they could not; <hi>The ſecret of the Lord is with them that fear him; and he will ſhew them his Covenant,</hi> Pſalm 25.14. <hi>But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are fooliſhneſs unto him, neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.14.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then ſpake the</hi> Chaldeans <hi>to the King in</hi> Syriack, <hi>O King live for ever: Tell thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants the Dream, and we will ſhew the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation,</hi> verſe 4.

            <p>
               <hi>The King anſwered and ſaid to the</hi> Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans, <hi>The thing is gone from me.</hi> He had forgot it, but was ſo d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>But if ye ſhew the Dream, and the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation thereof, ye ſhall receive of me gifts, and rewards, and great honour: therefore ſhew me the Dream, and the Interpretation thereof,</hi> verſe 6. Theſe promiſes and threatenings prevailed not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They anſwered again, and ſaid, Let the King tell his Servants the Dream, and we will ſhew the Interpretation of it,</hi> verſe 7.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The King anſwered and ſaid, I know of a certainty, that ye would gain the time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ye ſee the thing is gone from me.</hi> Here the King gives his opinion of the Wiſe Men of <hi>Babylon,</hi> that they were no other than flatterers and liars, <hi>For ye have prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red lying and corrupt words to ſpeak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the Dream, and I ſhall know that ye can ſhew me
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59933:21"/> the Interpretation thereof,</hi> verſe 8, 9.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> Chaldeans <hi>anſwered before the King, and ſaid, there is not a man upon Earth that can ſhew the Kings matter,</hi> verſe 10. Here they make their defence for themſelves, and pleaded the unreaſonableneſs of the thing, that was required of them, <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is no King, Lord, or Ruler, that asked ſuch things at any Magician, or Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loger, or</hi> Chaldean. <hi>And it is a rare thing that the King requireth, and there is none other that can ſhew it before the King, except the Gods, whoſe dwelling is not with fleſh,</hi> ver. 11. That they ſhould be put to death for not making known that to the King, which themſelves did not know; that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed was like a Heathen.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And the King commanded to deſtroy all the Wiſe Men of</hi> Babylon, <hi>verſe</hi> 12.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And the Decree went forth, that the Wiſe Men ſhould be ſlain,</hi> verſe 13. <hi>Daniel</hi> hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of what had paſſed between the King, and the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> and fearing leſt himſelf and his Fellows ſhould have been ſlain with them, he went firſt to the King, and deſired of him, that he would give him time, and he would ſhew the King the Interpretation. That was granted, <hi>verſe</hi> 16.</p>
            <p>Daniel <hi>then went to his houſe, and made
<pb facs="tcp:59933:22"/> the thing known to his companions, that they would deſire mercies of the God of Heaven concerning this ſecret; that</hi> Daniel <hi>and his Fellows ſhould not periſh with the reſt of the Wiſe Men of</hi> Babylon. <hi>Then was the ſecret revealed unto</hi> Daniel <hi>in a Night-viſion: then</hi> Daniel <hi>bleſſed the God of Heaven.</hi> By this the name of God was bleſſed and praiſed, the King was ſatisfied, the Wiſe Men of <hi>Babylon</hi> ſaved: <hi>Daniel</hi> honoured, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded, and this great ſecret revealed, <hi>verſe</hi> 17, 18, 19.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Daniel</hi> ſhews King <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi> the Dream or Viſion. <hi>Thou, O King, ſaweſt, and behold, a great Image: this great Image, whoſe brightneſs was excellent, ſtood before thee, and the form thereof was terrible. This Images head was of fine gold, his breaſt and his arms of ſilver, his belly and his thighs of braſs, his legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay. Thou ſaweſt till that a ſtone was cut out without hands, which ſmote the Image upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and brake them in pieces. Then was the iron, the clay, the braſs, the ſilver and gold broken to pieces together, and became like the chaſt of the ſummer threſhing-floors, and the wind car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried them away, that no place was found for them: and the ſtone that ſmote the Image be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a great mountain, and filled the whole
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59933:22"/> Earth,</hi> verſe 31. <hi>to</hi> verſe 35. This is the Dream that is certain.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Daniel</hi> tells King <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar</hi> the Interpretation thereof. <hi>Thou, O King, art a King of Kings, for the God of Heaven hath given thee a Kingdom, power, and ſtrength, and glory. And whereſoever the children of men dwell, the beaſts of the field, and the fowls of the Heaven, hath he given into thine hand, and hath made thee ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler over them all; thou art this head of gold. And after thee ſhall ariſe another Kingdom inferior to thee, and another third Kingdom of braſs, which ſhall bear rule over all the Earth. And the fourth Kingdom ſhall be as ſtrong as iron: Foraſmuch as iron breaketh in pieces, and ſubdueth all things: And as iron that breaketh all theſe, ſhall it break in pieces and bruiſe. And whereas thou ſaweſt the feet and toes, part of potters clay, and part of iron: the Kingdom ſhall be divided, but there ſhall be in it of the ſtrength of the iron, foraſmuch as thou ſaweſt the iron mixed with miry clay. And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay; ſo the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſhall be partly ſtrong, and partly broken. And whereas thou ſaweſt iron mixt with miry clay, they ſhall mingle themſelves with the ſeed of men: but they ſhall not cleave
<pb facs="tcp:59933:23"/> one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This hath brought me to the words of my text.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>And in the days of theſe Kings ſhall the God of Heaven ſet up a Kingdom, which ſhall never be deſtroyed: And the Kingdom ſhall not be left to another people, but it ſhall break in pieces, and conſume all theſe Kingdoms, and it ſhall ſtand for ever.</head>
               <p>IN the opening of theſe words I ſhall ſhew,</p>
               <p>Firſt, What this Kingdom is.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Who it was that ſhould ſet up this Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Of the time of its being ſet up.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The power, ſtrength, and glory of this Kingdom, and that in four things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it ſhall never be deſtroyed.</p>

               <p n="4">4. It ſhall ſtand for ever.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, This Kingdom is the Church,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59933:23"/> the True Church, the Church of God upon Earth, this Church hath many Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, but one glorious Head the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt: The Church is called a Spouſe, a Bride, a Flock, a Vineyard, a Garden, a Body, a Houſe, a Family, but here in the Text it is called a Kingdom, as alſo in other places of Scripture. <hi>That ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his Kingdom and Glory,</hi> 1 Theſ. 2.12. You are called of God, and you are called to a Kingdom, and it is the Kingdom of God: O walk worthy of it, you that are called to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Who hath delivered us from the power of darkneſs, and hath tranſlated us into the Kingdom of his dear Son,</hi> Col. 1.13.

               <p>Secondly, The Church of God is called a Nation. <hi>Open ye the gates, that the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous

The Church of God is a righteous Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that keeps the truth, a holy Nation that ſhews forth the praiſes of God: This is a <hi>nation out of every nation, and a people out of every people, and are redeemed from the earth, and from amongſt men; and haſt made us unto our God Kings and Prieſts, and we ſhall reign on the earth,</hi> Rev. 5.9, 10. O what Nation ſo wiſe and great as this Nation! What ſo excellent and bleſſed as this Nation!

               <p n="3">3. Theſe inviſible things of God are manifeſt, and underſtood by the things that are made, even his Eternal Power and Godhead.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This leaves men without excuſe.</p>
               <p>O how great and glorious is the Power and Wiſdom of God! by his power he cleav'd the Earth with Rivers, and by his Power he placed the Sands for the bounds of the Sea by a perpetual decree, that the Waters cannot paſs over: by his Power Birds fly, and by his Power Fiſhes ſwim by his Power Graſs and other things of the Earth grow, and by his Power the Stars of Heaven move, and the Sun runs its race. <hi>The Heavens declare the glory of God and the Firmament ſheweth his handy work Day unto day uttereth ſpeech, and night unto night ſheweth knowledge,</hi> Pſalm 19.1, 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that glory which is above all expreſſions, and beyond all apprehenſions.</p>
               <p>God ſpeaks to the Inhabitants of the Earth by heavenly bodies, <hi>Day unto day they utter ſpeech, and night unto night they
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:59933:26"/> ſhew knowledge.</hi> Though Nations under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not one anothers Language; yet all Nations underſtand this Language that God ſpeaks to them by the works of his hands; theſe all ſhine out gloriouſly, they move orderly, and continue to all gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations: they are as glorious now as they were the firſt moment that they were made, and came out of the hand of God: this is that which the Lord hath divided unto all Nations under the whole Heaven, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.19. namely the Sun, Moon, and Stars; not that men ſhould worſhip them, but admire and praiſe that God that made them; and if the Pavement of Heaven be ſo glorious; O what then is that glory which is within! Of all ingredients Light is the moſt excellent, this is that makes one Star differ from another in glory. O Lord how manifold are thy Works! in Wiſdom haſt thou made them all, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 104.24.</p>
               <p>Secondly, See his mercy and goodneſs in his providences. God holds the whole frame of Nature in his hand; from the higheſt Angels to the loweſt Worm, they are all under his care; He exerciſeth a providence in the Government of the whole World; He ruleth in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of Men, and giveth it to whomſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:59933:27"/> he will; He is wonderful in counſel, glorious in Holineſs, rich in Mercy, high in Power, and yet full of Pity and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion; <hi>like as a Father pitieth his Children; ſo the Lord pitieth them that fear him;</hi> and he pitieth them moſt when they are in trouble, and in diſtreſs, under ſore affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and great tryals.

Ships that go upon the great and wide Sea from Nation to Nation, are often wind bound, and cannot make their way, and ſometimes lie at their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:59933:27"/> for want of a fair wind, many days and weeks: the poor ſea-men look out, and look up to Heaven for a Wind, that they may proceed on their Voyage, then they are troubled ſaying, O! that we had a fair wind to carry us to our deſired port; then the Lord ſheweth his mercy, and goodneſs to them, in turning the wind, and brings it about, and carrys them to their deſired haven: then they are glad and rejoyce, and bleſs and praiſe his holy name, that <hi>bringeth forth the Wind out of his Treaſures,</hi> Jer. 10.13. So when they meet with foul weather at ſea, and are in great diſtreſs, and danger of being caſt away; the Sea working, the Waters ſtanding up like ſo many Mountains; the Wind bearing hard on them; then all hopes of life and ſafety are taken from them, then fear ſeizeth them, and the thoughts of drowning terrifies them: O! we ſhall go down to the bottom of the Sea, and we are afraid, we ſhall riſe up again in the flames of Hell; then they unto the Lord do cry for help, when none can help them but the God of Heaven; he ſpeaks to the Winds, and bids them be ſtill, and they obey him, and to the raging Sea, and the Waters become quiet and ſtill; <hi>Then they ſee the works of the Lord, and his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb facs="tcp:59933:28"/> in the deep, his goodneſs and mercies towards them.</hi> See the 107 Pſalm.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, See his love and grace in his word: <hi>More to be deſired are they than Gold, yea than much fine Gold: ſweeter alſo than honey and the honey comb; moreover, by them is thy Servant warned; and in keeping of them there is great reward,</hi> Pſalm 19.10, 11.</p>
               <p>The Prophet <hi>Micah</hi> makes an enquiry, and the enquiry is this: What will pleaſe the Lord? <hi>Will the Lord be pleaſed with thouſands of Rams: or with ten thouſands of Rivers of Oyl?</hi> Micah 6.7. Now if nothing leſs than this will pleaſe the Lord, then the Rich would be happy, and the poor would be miſerable. But the Prophet puts it farther; <hi>Shall</hi> I <hi>give my firſt born for my transgreſſion, the fruit of my Body for the Sin of my Soul?</hi> verſe 7.</p>
               <p>Poor People though they have not thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Rams, and ten thouſands of Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of Oyl, yet they have a great many Children to take care of, and to provide for: though they are their comforts, yet they are their care and trouble, to feed them, and cloth them; therefore to part with theſe, if the Lord ſhould require it of them, as he did of Abraham: <hi>And he ſaid, Take now thy Son, thine onely Son</hi> Iſaac,

O! ſee here, thouſands of Rams, and ten thouſands of Rivers of Oyl are not requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of thee, nor thy firſt Born, nor the fruit of thy Body, this is not required of thee, but to do Juſtly, and to love Mercy, and to walk Humbly with thy God, this is that which is required of thee: This is that good which the Lord hath ſhewed us. We have many to ſerve, but one to pleaſe, and that is God; he followeth us with his Mercies, and ſhall not we follow him by Prayer and Praiſes. He multiplies his mercies, that he may preſerve us, and he magnifies his mercies, that he may ſave us. The Lord will not allow, that the <hi>wiſe man ſhould glory in his wiſdom, nor the mighty man to glory in his might, nor the rich man to glory in his riches,</hi> Jeremiah 9.23. a man would think, that if any men under
<pb facs="tcp:59933:29"/> Heaven might glory, theſe might do it, and yet let not the wiſe man, let not the mighty man, let not the rich man glory in his riches, nor the mighty man glory in his might, nor the wiſe man glory in his wiſdom. If theſe men may not glory, who then may glory? ſee <hi>v.</hi> 24. <hi>But let him that glorieth, glory in this, that he underſtandeth and knoweth me, that I am the Lord, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe loving Kindneſs, Judgment and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs in the Earth: for in theſe things I delight, ſaith the Lord.</hi> A child of God may glory, but a child of wrath may not; a Son may glory, but a Slave may not; a Saint may glory, but a Sinner may not; he that glorieth in worldly-wiſdom, glorieth in fooliſhneſs; hath not God made fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the wiſdom of this world? <hi>For the world by wiſdom knew not God,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.20, 31. He that glorieth in carnal might, glorieth in nothing; he bringeth the Princes to nothing, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 40.23. he that glorieth in earthly riches, glorieth in that which is not; <hi>Wilt thou ſet thine eyes upon that which is not? For riches certainly make themſelves wings, they fly away as an Eagle towards Heaven.</hi> Prov. 23.5. Will men then glory in ſo little? This is the glory of Vanity: This is the glory of Pride, which the Lord will ſtain. The Lord of Hoſts
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:59933:29"/> hath purpoſed it, <hi>to ſtain the pride of all glory, and to bring into contempt all the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable of the Earth,</hi> Iſai. 23.9. But eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry true Child of God may glory in this, that they know the Lord experimentally, and ſavingly: His power that is ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, his ways that are ſo juſt, his word that is ſo true, his name that is ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, his wiſdom that is ſo great, his grace that is ſo full, his promiſes that are ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, his people that are ſo happy, his mercies that endure for ever, his works that are ſo wonderful, his Spirit that leads into all truth, his loving kindneſs that he never takes from them, and that glorious inheritance which is laid up in Heaven for them: now this every poor Saint may glory in; therefore let no man glory in men, <hi>for all things are yours,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.21.

               <p>Here you ſee is a cloud of witneſſes, the Prophets, and the Apoſtles, they have all teſtified, and ſpoken of this fully, and plainly, that the <hi>latter days,</hi> and <hi>laſt days</hi> are <hi>Goſpel days;</hi> For ſo are they called in the Scriptures of truth: then the days of theſe Kings were to be no other than Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel days: in the days of theſe Kings, that is, in Goſpel days.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Of the Kings, that were to be in Goſpel times, for if the days of theſe Kings were to be Goſpel days, then theſe Kings muſt be in Goſpel times.

And the ten Horns out of this Kingdom are ten Kings that ſhall ariſe, and another ſhall ariſe after them, and he ſhall be diverſe from the firſt, and he ſhall ſubdue three Kings, verſe</hi> 23, 24.

               <p>Thirdly, Of the way, and manner how this Kingdom was to be ſet up. It was propheſied by <hi>Iſaiah</hi> the Prophet; <hi>For un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given, and the Government ſhall be upon his ſhoulders:
<pb facs="tcp:59933:34"/> and his Name ſhall be called Wonderful, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor, the Mighty God, the Everlaſting Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Prince of Peace,</hi> Iſa. 9.6. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, thus ſaith the Lord God, Behold, I lay in</hi> Zion <hi>for a foundation, a ſtone, a trye<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſtone, a precious ſtone, a corner ſtone,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.6. <hi>a ſure foundation, and he that believeth on him, ſhall not be confounded,</hi> Iſa. 28.16. Now what way did God take to bring this about? this way, he made Providences fulfil Prophecies; <hi>And it came to paſs in thoſe days, that there went out a Decree from</hi> Caeſar Auguſtus, <hi>that all the World ſhould be taxed, and all went to be taxed, every one in his own City: And</hi> Joſeph <hi>alſo went up from</hi> Galilee, <hi>out of the City oſ</hi> Nazareth, <hi>into</hi> Judea, <hi>unto the City of</hi> David, <hi>which is called</hi> Bethlehem, (<hi>becauſe he was of the houſe and lineage of</hi> David) <hi>to be taxed with</hi> Mary <hi>his eſpouſed Wife, being great with child: And ſo it was, that while they were there, the days were accompliſhed that ſhe ſhould be delivered, and ſhe brought forth her firſt born Son,</hi> Luke 2.1. to 7. Little did <hi>Caeſar Auguſtus</hi> think, when he made this Decree, that all the World ſhould be taxed, what this was to do; what this was to accompliſh, and fulfil; this thing brought up the holy Child Jeſus from <hi>Galilee,</hi> out of the City of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> into
<pb facs="tcp:59933:34"/> 
                  <hi>Judea,</hi> unto the City of <hi>David,</hi> which is called <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> to be brought forth, and born there, according to the Scriptures; and they ſaid unto him, in <hi>Bethlehem</hi> of <hi>Judea: For thus it is written by the Prophet,</hi> Micah 5.2. Mat. 2.5. This brought the wiſe men from the Eaſt that came to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him, <hi>verſe</hi> 2. This brought the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel to the Shepherds, as they were abid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the field, keeping watch over their ſlock by night: This brought the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds to the Manger wherein the Babe lay. <hi>And when they had ſeen it, they made known abroad the ſaying which was told them concerning this Child, Luke</hi> 2, 16, 17. This brought the good tydings of great Joy, which ſhall be to all people, <hi>verſe</hi> 10. This Providence fulfill'd many Prophecies: <hi>As God had ſpoken by the mouth of his holy Prophets, which have been ſince the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, Luke</hi> 1.70. Then was fulfilled that Prophecy; <hi>Behold I lay in</hi> Zion <hi>for a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, a ſlone, a tryed ſtone, a precious cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſtone, a ſure foundation.</hi>

The Goſpel is called <hi>the everlaſting Goſpel, Rev.</hi> 14.6. becauſe it proceeded from God, the everlaſting Father. The Apoſtles did not receive the Goſpel they preached, from men, but from God; it was publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and preach'd by Chriſt Jeſus, the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Son of God; it was applied by the everlaſting Spirit of God; and the effects of the Goſpel will be everlaſting.

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:59933:41"/> an innumerable company of Angels, Heb.</hi> 12.22.

Heb.</hi> 1.14. The Scripture ſpeaks of a threefold Miniſtry.</p>

               <p>This Miniſtry the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were under, <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Prophets; but they did not underſtand them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Miniſtry of Angels: <hi>And they are miniſtring Spirits,</hi> ſent forth by God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, to miniſter for them who ſhall be heirs of Salvation, and the Church of God here on Earth, hath received from God many benefits, and great bleſſings by the hands of theſe bleſſed Angels; They hinder evil from us, and further
<pb facs="tcp:59933:41"/> good to us. They execute God's wrath, and vengeance, and judgments on wicked men; and they do comfort, and ſtrengthen and relieve Gods own People. This is very plain in Scripture, that they have done it, and we do all believe, they do it ſtill. Two Angels were ſent to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy <hi>Sodom,</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah. For we will deſtroy this place becauſe the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the Lord, and the Lord hath ſent us to deſtroy it,</hi> Gen. 19.13. <hi>And it came to paſs that night, that the Angel of the Lord went out, and ſmote in the Camp of the</hi> Aſſyrians <hi>an hundred four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore and five thouſand; and when they aroſe early in the morning, behold, they were all dead Corps,</hi> 2 Kings 19.35. <hi>And upon a ſet day,</hi> Herod <hi>arayed in royal apparel, ſat up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon his throne, and made an oration unto them. And the people gave a ſhout, ſaying, It is the voice of a God, and not of a man, and immediately the Angel of the Lord ſmote him, becauſe he gave not God the glory, and he was eaten of Worms, and gave up the Ghoſt,</hi> Acts 12.21, 22, 23. Angels, by a ſpecial command from God, do execute his wrath, and vengeance on wicked men. Perſecutors have been cut off, but no man ſaw the hand, that ſmote them; Gods Arrows have ſtuck faſt in them, though
<pb facs="tcp:59933:42"/> no man ſaw the Arm that drew the Bow, they have been ſuddenly removed, out of this world, into another. O! how many perſecuters have tumbled, fallen and periſhed. <hi>Surely thou didſt ſet them in ſlippery places; thou caſtedſt them down into deſtruction; how are they brought into deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation as in a moment? They are utterly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed with terrors, as a dream, when one awaketh; ſo, O Lord! when thou awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou ſhalt deſpiſe their image,</hi> Pſalm 73.18, 19, 20. O! how hath God made his Judgments manifeſt, and been a ſwift wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt perſecutors. Thoſe who were one day breathing out threatnings, and ſlaughter againſt the Servants of the Lord, the next day have been dead: have we not heard, and read this, the Angels that ſtand before God Almighty, wait but for a commiſſion and a command, but a look, to cut down ſuch wicked wretches. Now as Angels do execute Gods wrath, and vengeance on wicked perſecuters, ſo they do alſo ſtrengthen, and comfort Gods People under their ſoreſt tryals, and greateſt afflictions; when the Prophet <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſha</hi> was beſieg'd in <hi>Dothan</hi> by the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Army, the Angels of Heaven were ſent down to relieve him. <hi>And when the Servant of the man of God was riſen early
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:59933:42"/> and gone forth, behold, an Hoſt compaſſed the City, both with Horſes, and Chariots: and his ſervant ſaid unto him, Alas, my maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, how ſhall we do? and he anſwered, Fear not, for they that be with us, are more than they that be with them; and</hi> Eliſha <hi>prayed, and ſaid, Lord, I pray thee, open his eyes that he may ſee, and the Lord opened the eyes of the young man, and he ſaw; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, the mountain was full of Horſes, and Chariots of fire round about</hi> Eliſha, 2 King. 6.15, 16, 17.</p>
               <p>After <hi>Daniel</hi> had been mourning three full weeks, and humbled himſelf before the Lord, an Angel was ſent from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to ſtrengthen and comfort him. <hi>And he ſaid unto me, O!</hi> Daniel, <hi>a man greatly beloved, underſtand the Words that I ſhall ſpeak unto thee, and ſtand upright: for unto thee am I now ſent; and when he had ſpoken this word unto me, I ſtood trembling; then ſaid he unto me, Fear not,</hi> Daniel, <hi>for from the firſt day that thou didſt ſet thine Heart to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, and to chaſten thy ſelf before thy God, thy words were heard, and I am come for thy words; but the Prince of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of</hi> Perſia <hi>withſtood me one and twenty days; but lo!</hi> Michael <hi>one of the chief Princes came to help me, and I remained there with the Kings of</hi> Perſia. <hi>Now I am come

This is the woman that is clothed with the Sun. <hi>And there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared a great wonder in Heaven, a woman clothed with the Sun, and the Moon under her feet; and upon her head a Crown of twelve Stars, Rev.</hi> 12.1. This glory can no man
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:59933:46"/> ſtain, nor deſtroy; the glory of this World paſſeth away; let a man but ſhut his eyes, and the glory of this World will be darkned; every Saint in Heaven ſhines forth as the Sun, in the Kingdom of their Father, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.43. and every Saint now on the Earth, is more excellent than his Neighbour, <hi>Prov.</hi> 12.26. Men have beſtowed great charge and coſt on their high places, that they might ſet them off, and make them appear glorious to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders; and the poor and ignorant peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, have been greatly deceived by them, as if there were more holineſs in theſe places, than in others. Now this is not their glory, but their ſhame. The Spouſe of Chriſt Jeſus is glorious, the Lamb's wife: but what is it that makes her ſo glorious? Chriſt's righteouſneſs, that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers her, and his graces that enrich her, and fill her with all ſpiritual bleſſings: <hi>That he might preſent it to himſelf a glorious Church, not having ſpot nor wrinkle, or any ſuch thing; but that it ſhould be holy, and without blemiſh,</hi> Eph. 5.27. <hi>Now when I paſſed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold, thy time was the time of love, and I ſpread my skirt over thee, and covered thy nakedneſs, yea, I ſware unto thee, and entred into a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with thee, ſaith the Lord God, and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:59933:47"/> thou becameſt mine; then waſhed I thee with water, yea, I throughly waſhed away thy blood from thee, and I anointed thee with Oyl. I clothed thee alſo with broidered work, and ſhod thee with badgers skin, and I girded thee about with fine linnen, and I covered thee with ſilk. I decked thee alſo with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon thine hands, and a chain on thy neck. And I put a Jewel on thy forehead, and ear-rings in thine ears, and a beautiful Crown on thy head. Thus waſt thou decked with Gold and Silver, and thy ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was of fine Linnen, and Silk, and broi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dered work; thou didſt eat fine Flour, and Honey, and Oyl; and thou waſt exceeding beautiful, and thou didſt proſper into a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and thy renown went forth among the heathen, for thy beauty: for it was perfect through my comelineſs which I had put upon thee, ſaith the Lord God,</hi> Ezek. 16.8. to 14.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The ſecurity of this Church, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, the covenant, the word, Oath, Writings, Seals of the Omnipotent, and Wiſe God, <hi>that cannot Lie; that by two immutable things, in which it was impoſſible for God to Lie, we might have a ſtrong conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, who have fled for refuge, to lay hold upon the hope ſet before us,</hi> Heb. 6.18. the Church of God is ſometimes as a beſieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed City, Iſa. 1.8. the Devil and the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:59933:47"/> World beſiege it round, and the Enemies Joyn together, to devour Gods Iſrael with open mouth. There are three ways, that an Enemy uſually makes uſe of, to take a City that is beſieg'd.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By ſtarving of them, that they may have no ſupplies.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By undermining them, and blowing them up.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By scaling their Walls, that they may come at them to kill them.</p>
               <p>But this City, (the Church of God) the Enemies cannot deſtroy it, by any of theſe ways.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They cannot ſtarve the Church; <hi>He ſhall dwell on high; his place of defence ſhall be the munitions of Rocks, bread ſhall be given him, his water ſhall be ſure,</hi> Iſa. 33.16. <hi>But my God ſhall ſupply all your need, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his riches in glory, by Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Phil. 4.19. God hath ſet before his people an open door, which no man can ſhut; and this door is continually open night and day, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.8. all the Devils in Hell, and wicked Men on Earth, cannot ſhut it, and at this door come in the ſupplies of Gods Spirit, to every Child of God; here comes in that Joy that is unſpeakable, and full of glory, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.19. that peace which paſſeth all underſtanding; that love, that
<pb facs="tcp:59933:48"/> many waters cannot quench, nor floods drown it; that light and knowledg, that Gold cannot purchaſe; that ſpiritual ſtrength that makes them conquerers; at this door comes in that Kingdom of God, which is not meat, and drink, but righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and peace, and Joy in the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.17. <hi>Ho! every one that thirſteth, come ye to the Waters, and he that hath no Money; come ye, buy and eat; yea come, buy Wine and Milk without Money, and without Price,</hi> Iſa. 55.1. <hi>And the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and the Bride ſay, Come, and let him that heareth, ſay, Come, and let him that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thirſt, come, and whoſoever will, let him take of the water of Life freely,</hi> Rev. 22.17. By this you may ſee, the Church of God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſtarv'd, ſo as to be deſtroyed that way.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Enemies cannot deſtroy the Church of God by undermining it, and blowing it up, by all their Plots; for there have been Plots upon Plots, and Conſpiracies one after another, againſt the Church of Chriſt, but all in vain; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Church of God is builded upon a Rock. <hi>And I ſay alſo unto thee, That thou art</hi> Peter, <hi>and upon this Rock I will build my Church; and the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it, Matth.</hi> 16.18. Its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:59933:48"/> ſhall be the Munitions of Rocks, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.16. If the Church had not been built upon a Rock, <hi>Pharaoh</hi> had deſtroyed it long ago. <hi>And he ſaid, Come on, let us deal wiſely with them: and they did ſet over them Task-maſters, to afflict them with bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, and made them to ſerve with rigour; and they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in Mortar, and in Brick, and in all manner of ſervice in the field; all the ſervice wherein they made them ſerve was with ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour; and the King of</hi> Egypt <hi>ſpake to the Hebrew women which were Midwives (of which the name of one was</hi> Shiphrah, <hi>and the name of the other</hi> Puah;) <hi>And he ſaid, When ye do the office of a Midwife to the Hebrew women, and ſee them upon the ſtools; if it be a Son, then ye ſhall kill him; but if it be a Daughter, then ſhe ſhall live, Exod.</hi> 1. See another like unto this in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>And when ye have found him, bring me word again, that I may come and worſhip him alſo. And he ſent forth, and ſlew all the children that were in</hi> Bethlehem, <hi>and in all the Coaſts thereof, from two years old and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, according to the time which he had dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently enquired of the wiſe men, Matth.</hi> 2.8, 16. Notwithſtanding, <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was ſo long before <hi>Herod,</hi> yet they were both of one mind, and in one ſpirit, and ſerved
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:59933:49"/> one Maſter (the Devil) againſt God, and his People; but what became of them both? God's wrath and vengeance took hold on them; they periſh'd, but God's Church was preſerv'd, becauſe it was built upon a Rock, and the Gates of Hell could not prevail againſt it. This King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſhall never be deſtroyed, by under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining, and blowing it up. <hi>When thou paſſeſt through the waters, I will be with thee, and through the rivers, they ſhall not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow thee; when thou walkeſt through the fire, thou ſhalt not be burnt, neither ſhall the flame kindle upon thee, Iſa.</hi> 43.2. God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vades his Enemies on every ſide, and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth through them, and cauſeth his Arrows to paſs through their hearts, and they ſtick ſo faſt, that their Phyſicians will not be able to pluck them out; but that Arm, and Bow, that ſhoots at the People of God, the Lord God will break that Arm and Bow. <hi>No weapon that is formed againſt thee, ſhall proſper; and every tongue, that ſhall riſe againſt thee in Judgment, thou ſhalt, condemn; this is the heritage of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the Lord, and their righteouſneſs is of me, ſaith the Lord, Iſa.</hi> 54.17.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Enemies of God's Church and People, ſhall never be able to deſtroy it; by getting over the Wall that is about it.</p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:59933:49"/>
               <p>Every wicked man is a fighter againſt God, an Enemy of Chriſt Jeſus; and on the Dragon's ſide, that makes war againſt the Church; but God hath given to his Church Armour, and alſo unto every Member of Chriſt. <hi>Put on the whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of God, that ye may be able to ſtand againſt the wiles of the Devil, Epheſ.</hi> 6.11. Other Armour will not ſerve the turn, it muſt be the Armour of God; put on the Armour of God; this will not do neither, unleſs it be the whole Armour of God; put on therefore the whole Armour of God, that you may be able to ſtand. The Church of God hath not only Armour, but Weapons alſo: <hi>For the Weapons of our warfare, are not carnal, but mighty through God,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4. That which makes theſe Weapons mighty, is, that they are through God; and that which makes them pull down ſtrong holds, is, that they are ſpiritual. This holy City, or Church of God, hath Walls and Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks about it, a Wall that the Enemies cannot ſcale, and get over: they that are within need not fear killing. <hi>We have a ſtrong City; ſalvation will God appoint for walls, and bulwarks,</hi> Iſa. 26.1. <hi>For I, ſaith the Lord, will be unto her a wall of fire round about, and will be the glory in the midſt of
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:59933:50"/> her, Zech.</hi> 2.5. This Wall <hi>Pharaoh</hi> could not break through, with all his Army, nor get over, to come at <hi>Iſrael,</hi> though he put on with all his might. <hi>The Enemy ſaid, I will purſue, I will overtake, I will divide the ſpoil: my luſt ſhall be ſatisfied upon them: I will draw my ſword; my hand ſhall deſtroy them, Exod.</hi> 15.9.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did but one of all theſe, that was, he purſued the Church, becauſe the Lord was between the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> as a Wall about his People; this wall the perſecuting Kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> could never break through, to deſtroy Gods Church, and People. <hi>For he that toucheth you, toucheth the Apple of his Eye,</hi> Zech. 2.8. when the Jews and the Gentiles both made an aſſault to uſe them deſpitefully, and to Stone them, <hi>Acts</hi> 14.5. God was then a Wall about his Church, that the Enemies could not deſtroy it; they are kept by his power, aſſiſted by his Spirit, comforted by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, ſtrengthned by his preſence, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by his word. <hi>The Lord God is their Sun and Shield, the Lord will give grace, and glory; no good thing will he with-hold from them that walk uprightly,</hi> Pſalm 84.11. <hi>Truſt ye in the Lord for ever; for in the Lord</hi> Jehovah <hi>is everlaſting ſtrength,</hi> Iſa. 26.4.
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:59933:50"/> the Church of God hath the ſame ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty now, that it ever had in all times, and it is the ſame ſecurity that Angels have, for their ſtanding and continuing for ever, in Heavenly glory and happineſs, for they are upheld by the word of his power: <hi>Who being the brightneſs of his glory, and the expreſs image of his Perſon, and upholding all things by the word of his Power, when he had by himſelf purged our ſins, ſate down on the right hand of the Majeſty on high,</hi> Heb. 1.3. Gods truth and faithfulneſs in his word confirms, and fixes them; they take hold of this as we do, and rejoyce in it: <hi>To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places, might be made known by the Church the manifold wiſdom of God,</hi> Eph. 3.10. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto whom it was revealed, that not unto themſelves, but unto us, they did miniſter the things which are now reported un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, by them that have preached the Goſpel unto you, which the Holy Ghoſt ſent down from Heaven; which things the Angels deſire to look into,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.12. <hi>And I fell at his feet, to worſhip him, and he ſaid unto me, See thou do it not: I am thy fellow-ſervant, and of thy Brethren that have the Teſtimony of Jeſus; worſhip God,</hi> Rev. 19.10. <hi>And I</hi> John <hi>ſaw theſe things, and heard them, and when I had heard and ſeen, I fell down to worſhip
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:59933:51"/> before the feet of the Angel, which ſhewed me theſe things: Then ſaith he unto me, See thou do it not: for I am thy fellow-ſervant, and of thy Brethren the Prophets, and of them which keep the ſayings of this Book; worſhip God, Rev.</hi> 22.8, 9. If the heavenly Angels ſhould ſay to God Almighty, Lord, what aſſurance haſt thou given unto us, that we fall not, and be not caſt down to the fallen Angels? What ſecurity have we, for our ſtanding, and abiding here in Heaven, and to continue in this glory and happineſs for ever and ever? Would not God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty then anſwer, and ſay unto them, You have my Word, my faithful ſayings; the Word of a God that is true and certain, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.87. <hi>They had almoſt conſumed me upon Earth: but I forſook not thy Precepts. For verily I ſay unto you, Till Heaven and Earth paſs, one jot, and one tittle ſhall in no wiſe paſs from the Law, till all be fulfilled,</hi> Mat. 5.18. <hi>Heaven and Earth ſhall paſs away: but my words ſhall not paſs away,</hi> Mar. 13.31. <hi>And it is eaſier for Heaven and Earth to paſs, than one tittle of the Law to fall, Luk.</hi> 16.17. This is the aſſurance that God hath given both to Angels and Men; if there were as many Enemies, as there be drops of water in the Sea, they ſhall not be able to deſtroy this Kingdom (the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:59933:51"/> Church of God on Earth) <hi>There ſhall not an hair of your head periſh, Luke</hi> 21.18. Perſecutors may kill, but they cannot overcome; they may lay low, but they cannot lay waſte; they may ſpoil, but they cannot utterly deſtroy; the Martyrs won the day. <hi>And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their Teſtimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death, Rev.</hi> 12.11. Men live upon their Inheritance, and therefore are not willing to part with that, at any rate. The Church is God's Portion, and his Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; <hi>For the Lord's Portion is his People;</hi> Jacob <hi>is the Lot of his Inheritance, Deut.</hi> 32.9. The Saints are God's Jewels, which he will not ſuffer to be deſtroyed, but will make them up. <hi>And they ſhall be mine, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, in that day when I make up my Jewels, and I will ſpare them as a man ſpareth his own Son that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth him, Mal.</hi> 3.17. They are <hi>the Sheep of his Paſture, that enter into his Gates with thanksgiving, and into his Courts with praiſe, Pſal.</hi> 100 4. Theſe are they that God holds faſt in his hand, ſo faſt, that no man can pluck them out. <hi>I give unto them eternal life, and they ſhall never periſh, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall any man pluck them out of my hand: my Father that gave them me, is greater than
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:59933:52"/> all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand, John</hi> 10.28, 29. The Church is Chriſt's body, and this body can never be drown'd, as long as the head keeps above water: He is an Advocate for his Church in Heaven, and fights againſt the Dragon and his Angels here below. <hi>And there was war in Heaven,</hi> Michael <hi>and his Angels fought againſt the Dragon, and the Dragon fought and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, Rev.</hi> 12.7. The Church hath been a long time on a Sea of Glaſs mingled with Fire, and there ſhe will continue till the fourth Kingdom, <hi>that of Iron mixt with Clay, be broken to pieces, and become like Chaff of the Summer threſhing-floors, and the wind carry them away, that no place be found for them, Dan.</hi> 2.35. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Spouſe of Chriſt ſtands on a Sea of Glaſs, mingled with Fire, ſhe is not deſtroyed; <hi>And I ſaw as it were a Sea of Glaſs, mingled with Fire, and them that had gotten the victory over the Beaſt, and over his Image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, ſtand on the Sea of Glaſs, having the Harps of God; and they ſung the ſong of</hi> Moſes <hi>the Servant of God, and the ſong of the Lamb, ſaying, Great and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous are thy works, Lord God Almighty; juſt and true are thy ways, thou King of
<pb facs="tcp:59933:52"/> Saints. Who ſhall not fear thee, O Lord! and glorifie thy Name? for thou only art holy: for all Nations ſhall come and worſhip before thee; for thy Judgments are made manifeſt, Rev.</hi> 15.2, 3, 4. <hi>John</hi> the Divine, that out-lived all the Apoſtles, he being the laſt of them, as is believed, wrote this Book of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> in an excellent ſtile; the matter of it being excellent; it was ſent to him from Heaven: <hi>Write the things which thou haſt ſeen, and the things which are, and the things which ſhall be hereafter, Rev.</hi> 1.19. That is, from that time to this, and from this time to the end of the World, of all the things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Church of God in the latter days, and in the laſt days. Here we have a ſight of the Church often, in the fifth chapter of this Book. <hi>And they ſung a new ſong, ſaying, Thou art worthy to take the Book, and to open the Seals thereof: for thou waſt ſlain, and haſt redeemed us to God by thy blood, out of every Kindred, and Tongue, and People, and Nation, v.</hi> 9. This is a thankſgiving for their Redemption; being redeem'd by the blood of Chriſt, and delivered from wrath to come. In the twelfth chapter you have another ſight of the Church, <hi>A Woman clothed with the Sun, and the Moon under her feet,
<pb facs="tcp:59933:53"/> and upon her head a Crown of twelve Stars, v.</hi> 1. But againſt this Woman came the Red Dragon, with the power of Hell, to devour her Child as ſoon as it was born. The Devil and the World cannot endure the pure Worſhip of God, and the true Religion that is profeſs'd by God s Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
               <p>This Woman, the true Church of God, fled into the Wilderneſs, where ſhe had a place prepared of God; but the Dragon followed her, and made war with the remnant of her ſeed, <hi>which keep the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God, and have the teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> v. 17. that in the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Juſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in all times, the Church is the Mother, and the Womb that brings forth Gods faithful people in all ages; and though the Dragon in perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters hath made war againſt them, yet they could never deſtroy them.</p>
               <p>In the fourteenth Chapter you may ſee this Church <hi>following the lamb whereſoever he goes, and were redeem'd from among men, and from the Earth, and having his fathers name written in their foreheads, and in their mouths was found no guile; theſe were Virgin Saints, that had not drank of the Whores cup, nor been defiled with her abominations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You have a ſight again of this Church
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:59933:53"/> in the fifteenth chapter, which I mentioned before. <hi>And I ſaw as it were a ſea of Glaſs, mingled with fire, and them that had gotten the victory over the beaſt, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, ſtand on the ſea of Glaſs, having the Harps of God.</hi> See then theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things.</p>

                  <item>Their place.</item>
                  <item>Their poſture.</item>

               </list>
               <p n="1">1. Their place, as it were on a ſea of Glaſs, that is, the World, and the People that are in it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 46.2, 3. <hi>And four great beaſts came out from the Sea, divers one from another,</hi> Dan. 7.3. <hi>And I ſtood upon the ſand of the Sea, and ſaw a beaſt riſe up out of the Sea, having ſeven Heads and ten Horns, and upon his Horns ten Crowns, and upon his Heads the name of Blaſphemy,</hi> Rev. 13.1. This Sea then, is the World, and in this World you ſhall have trouble.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Their poſture, <hi>They ſtand on the Sea of Glaſs;</hi> Glaſs is that which lets light into a room; wherever the Church of God is, there is light; light ſpringing up, light breaking forth, light ſhining out. Believers are Children of the day, and of the light; God hath ſhin'd into
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:59933:54"/> their hearts, in the face of Chriſt Jeſus. Now the World, and the Devil cannot endure this light, but blow up the coals, and kindle the fire of perſecution, that they may put out, and deſtroy this light of ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing knowledg. <hi>Beloved, think it not ſtrange concerning the fiery trial, which is to try you, as though ſome ſtrange thing happened unto you,</hi> 1 Pet. 4.12. This is the ſea of Glaſs, mingled with Fire; the fire of contention, the fire of perſecution, and the fire of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation; yet however Gods people ſtand, they ſtand faſt, and having done all, they ſtand, having their loins girt about with truth, and having on the breaſt-plate of righteouſneſs, and their feet ſhod with the preparation of the Goſpel of peace, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.13, 14, 15.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Their victory over the beaſt, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name; you ſee here who they are that get the victory, and this victory was got on the Sea of Glaſs mingled with fire; that is in priſons, and in dungeons, and in great tribulations, and in times of great calamities, under ſore trials. <hi>Who ſhall ſeparate us from the love of Chriſt? ſhall tribulation, or diſtreſs, or perſecution, or famine, or nakedneſs, or peril, or ſword, (as it is written, for thy ſake
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:59933:54"/> we are killed all the day long; we are account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as ſheep for the ſlaughter,) nay, in all theſe things we are more than conquerers, through him that loved us,</hi> Rom. 8.35, 36, 37. <hi>who through faith ſubdued Kingdoms, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Their Thankſgiving: They ſung a double ſong, the ſong of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the ſong of the Lamb; a ſong of Mercy, and a ſong of Judgment: They ſtood on the Sea of Glaſs mingled with Fire, and bleſt and prais'd the moſt high God, and gave thanks unto him for that Victory they had got over the Beaſt, and over his Image, and over his Mark, and over the number of his Name, and for the many mercies and bleſſings they had received from God Almighty; that their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences were not in captivity; that their Principles were not in chains; and that their Underſtandings were not in the Precepts of men. The Lord doth mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply mercies, and magnifie mercies, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in mercies, and follows his People with mercies and goodneſs all their days. <hi>Who delivered us from ſo great a death, and doth deliver: in whom we truſt, that he will yet deliver us.</hi> The Father of mercies fills his Children with mercies, and their mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies he fills with comforts; and for this they bleſs and praiſe his holy Name in all the Congregations of the Juſt: And as
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:59933:55"/> the mercies of God do always abound to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the righteous; ſo the Judgments of God are made manifeſt againſt the wicked.</p>
               <p>When the Church of God went out of <hi>Egypt, Pharaoh</hi> with his Army purſued after them, but he could never overtake them; and yet the Judgments of God ſoon overtook <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his Army. <hi>Then ſang</hi> Moſes <hi>and the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>this ſong unto the Lord, and ſpake, ſaying, I will ſing unto the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriouſly; the horſe and his rider hath he thrown into the Sea: The Lord is my ſtrength and ſong, and he is become my ſalvation: He is my God, and I will prepare him an habitation; my Father's God, and I will exalt him. The Lord is a man of war: the Lord is his name.</hi> Pharaoh<hi>'s Chariots and his Hoſt hath he caſt into the Sea: his choſen Captains alſo are drowned in the Red Sea; the depths have covered them, they ſank into the bottom as a ſtone. Thy right hand, O Lord, is become glorious in power; thy right hand, O Lord, hath daſhed in pieces the Enemy. And in the greatneſs of thine excellency thou haſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown them that roſe up againſt thee; thou ſenteſt forth thy wrath which conſumed them as ſtubble, Exod.</hi> 15.1. to 7.</p>
               <p>This was the ſong of <hi>Moſes,</hi> a ſong of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:59933:56"/> Mercy, and a ſong of Judgment; and this is the ſong of the Lamb, Mercy to his Church, and Judgment on his Enemies; he ſends forth his wrath, and conſumes his Enemies; he ſends forth his Mercies, and ſaves his People; and this is that which fills God's People with joy and gladneſs, and his Enemies with rage and madneſs. <hi>For when thy Judgments are in the Earth, the Inhabitant's of the World will learn righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, Iſa.</hi> 26.9.

               <p n="1">1. The Eyes of the Lord: <hi>The Eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and his Ears are open unto their cry,</hi> Pſal. 34 15. <hi>His Eyes run to and fro through the whole Earth,</hi> and they are never off from his own People; he beholds them with delight, and rejoyceth over them: his Eyes are on them for good, watching over them day and night.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Name of the Lord: <hi>And I looked, and lo, a Lamb ſtood on the Mount</hi> Sion, <hi>and with him an Hundred forty and four thouſand, having his Fathers name writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in their foreheads,</hi> Rev. 14.1. <hi>Him that overcometh, will I make a Pillar in the Temple of my God, and he ſhall go no more out: and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the City, which is New</hi> Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, <hi>which cometh down out of Heaven from my God: and I will write upon him a new name, Rev.</hi> 3.12. The Name of God is upon his People, and this ſhews to whom they do belong, and whoſe they are.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The comlineſs and glory of the Lord:
<pb facs="tcp:59933:58"/> 
                  <hi>And thy renown went forth among the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then for thy beauty, for it was perfect, through my comlineſs which I had put upon thee, ſaith the Lord,</hi> Ezek. 16.14. <hi>And the Lord will create upon every dwelling place of Mount</hi> Zion, <hi>and upon her Aſſemblies, a cloud, and ſmoke by day, and the ſhining of a flaming fire by night; for upon all the glory ſhall be a defence,</hi> Iſa. 4.5. <hi>If ye be reproached for the Name of Chriſt, happy are ye; for the Spirit of glory, and of God, reſteth upon you,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.14. Theſe are the things that are upon the righteous. And there are three things that God hath given to his People.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Himſelf: <hi>But this ſhall be the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant that I will make with the houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>after thoſe days, ſaith the Lord, I will put my Law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts, and will be their God, and they ſhall be my People,</hi> Jer. 31.33. <hi>They ſhall call on my Name, and I will hear them: I will ſay, It is my People; and they ſhall ſay, The Lord is my God,</hi> Zech. 13.9, <hi>For what agreement hath the Temple of God with Idols? for ye are the Temple of the living God, as God hath ſaid, I will dwell in them, and walk in them, and I will be their God, and they ſhall be my People,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A Kingdom: <hi>Fear not little flock; for
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:59933:58"/> it is your Father's good pleaſure to give you the Kingdom,</hi> Luke 12.32. <hi>And I appoint unto you a Kingdom, as my Father hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed unto me,</hi> Luke 22.29. <hi>Bleſſed are the poor in ſpirit: for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> Matth. 5.3.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Grace and Glory: <hi>For the Lord God is a Sun and Shield; the Lord will give grace and glory: no good thing will he with hold from them that walk uprightly,</hi> Pſal. 84.11. <hi>And he ſaid unto me, My grace is ſufficient for thee,</hi> 2 Cor. 12.9. <hi>Whether</hi> Paul, <hi>or</hi> Apollo, <hi>or</hi> Cephas, <hi>or the World, or Life, or Death, or things preſent, or things to come, all is yours,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.22. O Chriſtian! how canſt thou ſay, thou haſt nothing, or that thou haſt but little? Here is thy Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, ſee here what thy heavenly Father hath given thee, count it, and caſt it up. Thou haſt all things; God hath given thee himſelf, and a Kingdom; grace and glory, things preſent, and things to come; the world, life and death are all thine; how great is thy happineſs! O! wait but a little, and thou wilt be in the poſſeſſion of all.</p>
               <p>There be three things, that God will never take from his people, whiles they are in this life</p>
               <p n="1">1. His love and loving kindneſs. <hi>I
<pb facs="tcp:59933:59"/> have loved thee with an everlaſting love, therefore with loving kindneſs have I drawn thee,</hi> Jer. 31.3. <hi>He that hath my command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me, and he that loveth me ſhall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt my ſelf to him,</hi> John 14.21. <hi>Having loved his own which were in the World, he loved them unto the end,</hi> John 13.1. This the righteous are crown'd with in this life, <hi>He crowneth them with loving kindneſs, and tender mercies,</hi> Pſalm 103.4.</p>
               <p n="2">2. His Spirit. <hi>And I will pray the Father, and he ſhall give you another comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that he may abide with you for ever, even the ſpirit of truth,</hi> John 14.16, 17. <hi>but the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-ſuffering, gentleneſs, goodneſs, ſaith, meekneſs, temperance,</hi> Gal. 5.22, 23.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Know ye not that ye are the temple of God; and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.16. God will not leave his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren comfortleſs, he will not leave them orphans; the Spirit of God dwells in them, and abides with them, and reſteth upon them, and leads them into all truth; it convinceth ſinners, and it comforteth Saints, <hi>For the Spirit it ſelf maketh interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for us with groanings which cannot be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.</hi>

               <p n="3">
                  <pb facs="tcp:59933:59"/>3. His Preſence, which is the glory of his People, and the glory in the midſt of them, <hi>God is in the midſt of her: ſhe ſhall not be moved; God ſhall help her, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Member of Chriſt hath in him a vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Faith, a lively Hope, a ſaving Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, a meaſure of the Spirit, and a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of Grace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Chriſts Church is a fruitful Church, <hi>I am the Vine, ye are the branches; he that abideth in me, and I in him, the ſame bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth much fruit; for without me ye can do nothing, John</hi> 15.5. you ſee here Chriſt Jeſus is the Vine, and Believers are the Branches, the bleſſed Jeſus will never leave theſe branches, for without him they can do nothing, but in him they are more than Conquerors, and do bring forth the fruits of Righteouſneſs, love, and Charity: love towards God, and charity towards men, they do bring forth out of that treaſure of grace that is in them, good lives and converſations, living righteouſly, and godly in this preſent world; all the Children of God, that are in this world, they are but as ſo many branches of this Vine, they are but as ſo many limbs of this Tree; they are but ſo many little partys and bodys, that make up this body of Chriſt, the Church of God; that <hi>ſhall not be left to another people.</hi>

               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:59933:62"/>3. They are his flock. <hi>I am the good ſhepherd of the ſheep, and know my ſheep, and am known of mine, John</hi> 10.14. Our Lord Jeſus is that good ſhepherd and paſtor, that feeds all the members of his body, he will not leave them, nor fly from them; that is the part of an hireling, <hi>the hireling fleeth, becauſe he is an hireling, and careth not for the ſheep, v.</hi> 13. when he was on Earth, he did not leave them, but watcht over them, and preacht peace to them, and nouriſhed and cheriſhed them, and fed them with that truth, which he had received from the Father, and often pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for them; and when he left the Earth and went to Heaven, <hi>there he ever liveth to make interceſſion for them. But this man; becauſe he continueth ever, hath an unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Prieſt-hood, wherefore he is able to ſave them to the uttermoſt, that come unto God by him, ſeeing he ever liveth to make inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for them,</hi> Heb. 7.24, 25. <hi>For there is one God, and one Mediator between God and Men, the Man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.5. <hi>My little Children, theſe things write I unto you, that ye ſin not, and if any man ſin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.1. Every believer feeds on Chriſt Jeſus by Faith, he ſups with them, and they with
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:59933:62"/> him, and when they leave this life, then they live and reign with Chriſt in the Heavenly glory.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Church of God hath a fountain; and this fountain is the Lord, the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of life; and from this fountain come the ſtreams, that make glad the City of God; this fountain is always flowing, and over-flowing, with love and kindneſs, mercy, and grace, righteouſneſs and truth; <hi>They ſhall be abundantly ſatisfied with the fatneſs of thy houſe; and thou ſhalt make them drink of the River of thy pleaſures; for with thee is the fountain of life; in thy light we ſhall ſee light,</hi> Pſalm 36.8, 9. <hi>But who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever drinketh of the Water that I ſhall give him, ſhall never thirſt; but the water that I ſhall give him, ſhall be in him, a well of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſpringing up into everlaſting life,</hi> John 4.14. <hi>He that beleiveth on me, as the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath ſaid, out of his belly ſhall flow rivers of living water, John</hi> 7.38. Theſe rivers of living water will never be dried up, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is water of life, and it flows from a fountain of life, that doth always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh, ſtrengthen, and comfort the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God. <hi>For they drank of that ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al rock that followed them, and that rock was Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.4.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Church of Chriſt is a Bride,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:59933:63"/> the Lambs wife: <hi>And Jeſus ſaid unto them, Can the Children of the Bride-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber mourn, as long as the Bridegroom is with them? But the days will come when the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom ſhall be taken from them, and then ſhall they faſt,</hi> Matth. 9.15. <hi>He that hath the Bride, is the Bridegroom; but the friend of the Bridegroom, which ſtandeth and heareth him, rejoyceth greatly, becauſe of the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom's voice: this my Joy therefore is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled,</hi> John 3.29. <hi>And the Spirit and the Bride ſay, Come; and let him that hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſay come; and let him that is athirſt, come; and whoſoever will, let him take of the waters of life freely,</hi> Rev. 22.17. <hi>And there came unto me one of the ſeven Angels, which had the ſeven Vials full of the ſeven laſt Plagues, and talked with me, ſaying, Come hither, I will ſhew thee the Bride, the Lamb's wife, Rev.</hi> 21.9. This glorious Bride is the Church, and this Church is the Kingdom, that ſhall not be left to another people.</p>

Will men leave that which they have purchas'd to their worſt and greateſt Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies?

               <p>Now if this be ſo who can believe, who can think, that the Church of God ſhall be left to another People.</p>

               <p>Thirdly, The holy Spirit will not leave them; the ſpirit of truth, that dwelleth with you and ſhall be in you; <hi>I will not leave you comfortleſs,</hi> John 14.17, 18. <hi>know ye not that your body is the Temple of the holy Ghoſt which is in you, which ye h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This holy Spirit of God is given, &amp; it is given to them that ask it. <hi>If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your Children, how much more ſhall your heavenly father give the holy ſpirit to them that ask him, Luk.</hi> 11.13. Every true believer hath this ſpirit of Chriſt in him; <hi>But if the ſpirit of him that raiſed up Jeſus from the dead dwell in you, he that raiſed up Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus from the dead, ſhall alſo quicken your mortal bodies, by his ſpirit that dwelleth in you, Rom.</hi> 8.11. This Spirit of God is to be found no where but in the Church of God, and in every member of that body; <hi>Now if any man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his, v.</hi> 9. As a tree is known by the fruit it bears, ſo is the ſpirit known to be in a man, by the fruits he brings forth; <hi>The fruit of the Spirit, is love, joy, peace,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:59933:64"/> long-ſuffering, gentleneſs, goodneſs, faith, meekneſs, temperance; againſt ſuch there is no law,</hi> Gal 5.22, 23.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, the Spirit of God convinceth</p>
               <p>Secondly, it quickeneth.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it leadeth.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, it ſtrengtheneth.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, it comforteth.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, it maketh interceſſion.</p>

               <p>Ninthly, it revealeth.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, it reſteth on you.</p>
               <p>That good work, that is begun in any man or woman, and carried on from firſt to laſt, is attributed to the Spirit of God. The father he ordains, calleth and chuſeth and hath bleſſed us with all ſpiritual bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, in heavenly places, in Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.3.</p>
               <p>The Son he hath redeemed us, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered us, from wrath, from ſin, and from the world, and from the curſe of the law, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.68.</p>
               <p>The Spirit he applies all that to us, that God hath given, and Chriſt purchas'd, and from hence it ariſeth, that there is ſo much contention, and diſagreement amongſt men, this is that, which brings a Sword, that brings a War, and makes diviſions, and one man to hate and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:59933:65"/> another, namely, from the ſeed that is in them, and from the Spirit that is in them. <hi>For he that is born after the fleſh, perſecuted him that was born after the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, even ſo it is now,</hi> Gal. 4.29. <hi>For the fleſh luſteth againſt the ſpirit, and the ſpirit againſt the fleſh, and theſe are contrary one to the other,</hi> Gal. 5.17. It is ſo contrary, that you may find this in the neareſt rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as husband and wife, parents and children, brothers and ſiſters, if any of them be in the Spirit of God, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened, and renewed in their minds, and the others be not, but are in the ſpirit of the evil one, in the ſpirit of the world, under darkneſs, and blindneſs; there can be then no agreement, but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord and diviſion, and they are contrary one to the other, as to ſpiritual things: <hi>For the world knows not the Spirit of God, neither can it receive it.</hi> Take two men, that were great ſtrangers one to the other; the one living in the Eaſt <hi>Indies,</hi> and the other in the Weſt; and after ſome time, they both return home to this land; and by a ſpecial providencae they here meet together, and after a little diſcourſe one with the other, they ſo well agree, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing knit together in love<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they could even live and the together, becauſe they
<pb facs="tcp:59933:65"/> were of one ſpirit, the Spirit of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in them both, and that unites them, and makes them to be one in hope, and faith, in love and affection. The mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſts body are many, but one ſpirit in them all, endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. <hi>There is one body and one ſpirit, even as you are called in one hope of your calling, one Lord, one faith, one baptiſm, one God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all, Eph.</hi> 4.3 4, 5, 6. This bleſſed Spirit did never leave the Church of God, nor never will, ſo long as God hath a Church here on Earth; this Spirit of God leads every true believer into all truth, and from ſtrength to ſtrength, and from glory to glory, from one degree of grace to another, till they are taken up into the heavenly glory, and to be with Chriſt Jeſus, and with the Spirits of Juſt men made perfect.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The bleſſed Angels will not leave them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Angels did proclaim the birth of our Saviour. <hi>And ſuddenly there was with the Angel a multitude of the Heavenly Hoſt, praiſing God, and ſaying, Glory to God in the higheſt, and on Earth peace, good will towards men,</hi> Luke 2.13, 14.</p>
               <p n="2">

They do rejoyce at the converſion of ſinners; <hi>I ſay unto you, that likewiſe Joy ſhall be in Heaven over one ſinner that repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, more than over ninety and nine Juſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which need no repentance,</hi> Luke 15.7.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The Angels of the Lord encamp round about them that fear him, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, Pſal. 34.7. <hi>For we are made a ſpectacle unto the world, and to Angels, and to men,</hi> 1 Cor. 4.9. <hi>For this cauſe ought the Woman to have power on her Head, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Angels,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.10.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They are all miniſtring Spirits; <hi>Spirits ſent forth to miniſter for them who ſhall be Heirs of Salvation,</hi> Heb. 1.14.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Lazarus</hi> died, and was carried by the Angels into <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſom, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.22.</p>
               <p>The myſtery of Angels we ſhall better underſtand in the next world, than we do in this; but this is certain, the Church of God receives great benefits by them, as I have prov'd before. They are Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits that are inviſible; They enter into our Houſes, as the light doth; They take up no room, nor juſtle any body aſide; They ſee and behold us, though we ſee not them, and do us good though we know it not, and oftentimes keep evil from us, though we do not underſtand it.
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:59933:66"/> Heaven is their countrey, yet they are often upon the Earth, and do know the ſtate and condition of the Church better than we do; <hi>Then the Angel of the Lord anſwered, and ſaid, O Lord of Hoſts, how long wilt thou not have me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

By this you may ſee, God the Father will not leave his Children; Chriſt Jeſus the Son of God, will not leave the Members of his Body; the Spirit of God will not leave its temple, that he dwells in; the Angels of God will not leave the charge that is committed to them: <hi>The Kingdom ſhall not be left to an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

By this it appears very plain, that the Kingdom ſhall not be left to another People.</p>
               <p>Secondly; It ſhall not be left to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther People: <hi>The people ſhall dwell alone, and ſhall not be reckoned among the Nations.</hi> This people ſhall not mingle themſelves with other people, <hi>Numb.</hi> 23.9.

               <p>When men leave the precepts of God, and follow the precepts of men; when men leave the ſcriptures of truth, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:59933:76"/> the traditions of men; when men leave the pure worſhip of God, and follow Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry; when men leave <hi>the path of the Juſt, that ſhineth more and more unto the perfect day, and walk in the way of</hi> Baal; <hi>then their Hearts are darkned, and their minds are blinded, and their underſtandings are</hi> cloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that they ſee not whither they go; then they ſubmit to any thing, then they bow down to any thing, and worſhip any thing; thus did the <hi>Gentiles, they changed the glory of the uncorruptible God, into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and to four-footed beaſts, and to creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things, and worſhiped and ſerved the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture more than the Creator, Rom</hi> 1.23, 25.</p>
               <p>Thus did the <hi>Jews</hi> do of old. <hi>And the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>did ſecretly thoſe things that were not right, againſt the Lord their God; and they built them high places in all their Cities, from the Tower of the Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, to their fenced City. And they ſet them up images and groves in every high hill, and under every green Tree, and they burnt incenſe in all the high places, as did the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then whom the Lord carried away before them, and wrought wicked things to provoke the Lord to anger, for they ſerved Idols, whereof the Lord had ſaid unto them, Ye ſhall not do this thing; yet the Lord teſtified againſt</hi> Iſrael,
<pb facs="tcp:59933:76"/> 
                  <hi>and againſt</hi> Judah, <hi>by all the Prophets, and by all the Seers, ſaying, Turn ye from your evil ways, and keep my commandments, and my ſtatutes, according to all the Law, which I have commanded your Fathers, and which I ſent to you by my Servants the Prophets; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they would not hear, but harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Necks like to the Necks of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that did not believe in the Lord their God, and they rejected his ſtatutes, and his covenants that he had made with their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and his teſtimonies which he had teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied againſt them, and they followed vanity, and became vain, and went after the Heathen that were round about them, concerning whom the Lord had charged them, that they ſhould not do like them, and they left all the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Lord their God, and made them molten images, even two calves, and made a grove, and worſhiped all the hoſt of Heaven, and ſerved</hi> Baal, <hi>and they cauſed their Sons and their Daughters to paſs through the Fire, and uſed Divination, and Inchantments, and ſold themſelves to do evil in the ſight of the Lord, to provoke him to anger,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 17.9, <hi>to</hi> 17.</p>
               <p>O learn from hence theſe four things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, When men leave God, God leaves them; when men leave truth, truth leaves them; when men leave the true
<pb facs="tcp:59933:77"/> Church, the Church leaves them. <hi>I ſaid indeed, that thy houſe, and the houſe of thy father ſhould walk before me for ever, but now the Lord ſaith, Be it far from me; for them that honour me, I will honour, and they that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe me ſhall be lightly eſteemed,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.30.</p>
               <p>Secondly, You may ſee, and underſtand by this, what that is, that blinds, and darkens, nations and people; the Devil darkens, Sin darkens, and the inventions of men darken; <hi>And he opened the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Pit, and there aroſe ſmoke out of the Pit, as the ſmoke of a great furnace, and the Sun and the Air were darkened by reaſon of the ſmoke of the Pit, and there came out of the ſmoke Locuſts upon the Earth, and unto them was given power, as the Scorpions of the Earth have power, Rev.</hi> 9.2, 3.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Marvel not then, that men are ignorant and blind, ſuperſtitious, and inventers of evil things; Idolaters and Blaſphemers. What wonder then is it to ſee theſe things, <hi>when men change the Truth of God into a Lie, and hold the Truth of God in unrighteouſneſs? And for this cauſe God ſhall ſend them ſtrong deluſions, that they ſhould believe a Lie; that they all might be damned, who believed not the Truth, but had pleaſure in unrighteouſneſs,</hi> 2 Theſ 2.11, 12. <hi>They feared the Lord, and ſerved their own Gods,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:59933:77"/> after the manner of the Nations, whom they carried away from thence,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 17.33.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Learn from hence the cauſe of the ſufferings of the People of God in all times. This hath been the flaming Sword of perſecution, that hath turn d every way againſt them, in all places; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the dark World by their inventions, and by their cruel Decrees. <hi>And it was given unto him to make war with the Saints, and to overcome them, and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And all that dwell upon the Earth ſhall worſhip him, whoſe names are not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the book of life of the Lamb ſlain from the foundation of the World, Rev.</hi> 13.7, 8. Here was a War, and this War was with the Saints, <hi>whoſe names were written in the book of Life of the Lamb ſlain from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the World.</hi> The cauſe of this War was for their not worſhipping the image of the beaſt; this the Saints of God could not do; and therefore they were ſlain. <hi>And cauſe that as many as would not worſhip the image of the beaſt, ſhould be killed; and that no man might buy or ſell, ſave he that had the mark or the name of the beaſt, or the number of his name, ver.</hi> 15.17. The Saints did not make the image; therefore they would not worſhip the
<pb facs="tcp:59933:78"/> image; they did not ſet up this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, neither will they be worſhipers of it, with the World. God gives life to his worſhip, but the Beaſt gave life to this, by forcing, and compelling; <hi>ſaying to them that dwell on the Earth, that they ſhould make an image to the beaſt; and he had pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to give life unto the image of the beaſt, that the image of the beaſt ſhould both ſpeak</hi> &amp;c. ver. 14, 15.</p>
               <p>This indeed is a myſtery, but if my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der be a Child of Light, he will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, by that little light I have here given him in this myſtery.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is an evil World; what evil is there out of Hell, that may not be ſeen in this World? What do you ſee in this World but evil? What is there done by this World but evil? And what do you expect from this World but evil? <hi>Who gave himſelf for our ſins, that he might deliver us from this preſent evil World, Gal.</hi> 1.4. When our Lord Jeſus was upon the Earth; he then prayed for them that did believe, and he prayed for them which ſhould believe on him hereafter; he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed long, and he prayed fervently, <hi>that all they whom the Father had given him, might be kept from the evil of the World,</hi> Joh. 17.15. <hi>Pure Religion and undefiled before God, and
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:59933:78"/> the father, is this, to viſit the fatherleſs and widdows in their affliction, and to keep him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unſpotted from the evil world, Jam.</hi> 1.27.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, What have the Saints of God ſeen in this World but evil, and do ſtill ſee it? men wallowing in the mire and filth of ſin, and all wickedneſs; pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for their own damnation; and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring up of wrath againſt their own Souls; marching in troops to Hell and Damnation. They are wiſe to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge, the thoughts of their hearts are evil and that continually; the words of their mouths are evil, full of curſing and bitterneſs; the works of their lives are evil being abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Love not the World, neither the things that are in the World; if any man love the World, the love of the Father is not in him:</hi> For all that is in the World, the luſt of the Fleſh, the luſt of the Eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the World, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.15, 16. you ſee here what is in the World; it is luſt, nothing but luſt; the luſt of the Fleſh, and the luſt of the Eyes, and the pride of Life; the luſt of drunkenneſs, the luſt of Swearing, the luſt of Uncleanneſs, the luſt of Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, the luſt of Idolatry, the luſt of
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:59933:79"/> Covetouſneſs, the luſt of Ambition, and of Pleaſures, and Idleneſs, a fulfilling the deſires of the Fleſh, and of the Mind; this is that the World is covered with as with a Garment. <hi>Then when luſt hath conceived, it bringeth forth ſin: and ſin when it is finiſhed, bringeth forth death,</hi> James 1.15.</p>
               <p>Secondly, what is done by the World but evil? Evil to themſelves, and Evil to the Saints. <hi>And moreover, I ſaw under the Sun the place of Judgment, that wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was there: and the place of Righteouſneſs, that iniquity was there,</hi> Eccl. 3.16. <hi>ſo I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, and conſidered all the oppreſſions that are done under the Sun, and behold, the tears of ſuch as were oppreſſed, and they had no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter; and on the ſide of the oppreſſors there was power, but they had no comforter. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I praiſed the dead, which are already dead, more than the living, which are yet alive; yea better is he than both they, which hath not yet been, who hath not ſeen the evil work that is done under the Sun, Eccl.</hi> 4.1, 2, 3.</p>
               <p>This is that which provokes the Lord, and the Eyes of his glory; and this is that, that hath made the Eyes of the people of God to run down with tears. <hi>Rivers of Waters run down mine Eyes, becauſe they
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:59933:79"/> keep not thy Law,</hi> Pſal. 119.136. <hi>Oh! that my head were Waters, and mine Eyes a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Tears, that I might weep day and night for the ſlain of the daughter of my People,</hi> Jer. 9.1. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto him, Go through the midſt of the City, through the midſt of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and ſet a mark upon the foreheads of the men that ſigh, and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the midſt thereof,</hi> Ezek. 9.4. <hi>And when he was come near, he beheld the City, and wept over it, ſaying, If thou hadſt known, even thou, at leaſt in this thy day the things which belong unto thy Peace? but now they are hid from thine Eyes,</hi> Lu. 19.41, 42. <hi>For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the Enemies of the Croſs of Chriſt; whoſe end if deſtruction, whoſe God is their Belly, and whoſe Glory is their ſhame, who mind Earthly things, Phil.</hi> 3.18, 19. Behold, and ſee, O perſecuting World! the love and pity, that is in the Hearts of Gods Children towards you. They ſigh, and mourn for your abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; they weep, and tears run down like water from their Eyes, for your ſins and wickedneſs; you perſecute them, and yet they pray for you; you hate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe them, yet they pity you; and ſeek, and endeavour to ſave you. You can
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:59933:80"/> commit ſin with both hands, but you do not ſigh and mourn; you can treaſure up wrath againſt your ſelves, but you cannot turn it away; you can pull down Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon you, but you cannot remove them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, What do you expect, that are the Saints of God, from this World but Evil? <hi>For I know your manifold tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions and your mighty ſins; they afflict the Juſt, they take a bribe, and turn aſide the poor in the gate from their right,</hi> Amos 5.12. <hi>Who hate the good, and love the evil, who pluck off their skin from off them, and their fleſh from off their b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nes; who alſo eat the fleſh of my people, and ſlay their skin from off them, and they break their bones, and chop them in pieces, as for the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ot, and as the fleſh within the Cauldron, Mic.</hi> 3.2, 3. if you look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the 11th of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> that little book of Martyrs, there you will ſee, what the ſufferings of Gods Children were of old; and if you read the Acts of the Apoſtles, that will ſhew you how cruel the world was then to the Church of God; and has it been kinder ſince? The Saints and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs have not found it ſo. <hi>Confirming the Souls of the diſciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we muſt through much tribulation enter into the Kingdom of
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:59933:80"/> God, Acts</hi> 14.22. A Leopard cannot change his ſpots, and a Lion cannot change his nature; no more can a wicked man ceaſe from evil; he hates the image of God wherever he ſees it. Let no good man expect good from the World; it did hate Chriſt Jeſus, and it now hates all his members; <hi>In the World ye ſhall have tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the World, Joh.</hi> 16.33. The World hath been always ſtorming the Church of God, and is always preparing to make new aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults expect therefore nothing from an evil World but evil; pray therefore that you may be kept from the evil of the World.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, It is a carnal World. <hi>For to be Carnally minded is Death but to be Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually minded, is Life and Peace.</hi> Here the Apoſtle ſhews the difference between a carnal man, and a ſpiritual man; A car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal man is dead, he hath no ſpiritual life in him, but a ſpiritual man hath both life and peace; that life which is eternal, <hi>John</hi> 10.28. and that peace which paſſeth all underſtanding. A carnal mans life is in himſelf, but a ſpiritual mans life is in Chriſt Jeſus. A carnal man receiv'd his life from God by Creation, but a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual man receiv'd his life from Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:59933:81"/> by grace; A carnal mans mind is Earthly, that is his ſin; but a ſpiritual mans mind is Heavenly, that is his Joy. A carnal mans mind cannot be ſubject to the Law of God; but the ſpiritual man, with his mind, <hi>ſerves the law of God, Rom.</hi> 7.25. A carnal mans mind is full of enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty againſt God, a ſpiritual mans mind is full of love to God. <hi>Becauſe the carnal mind is enmity againſt God, for it is not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the law of God, neither indeed can be, Rom.</hi> 8.7. Enemies may be reconcil'd, but Enmity never will be reconcil'd. This enmity that is in the Hearts, and minds of men againſt God is very great, and it ſhews it ſelf many ways.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They hate God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.30. Becauſe of his holineſs, his purity, his truth, his laws; and therefore God calls them his Enemies. <hi>Rule thou in the midſt of thine Enemies,</hi> Pſal. 110.2. <hi>Yea the fire of thine Enemies ſhall devour them,</hi> Iſaiah 26.11. <hi>But theſe mine Enemies which would not that I ſhould reign over them, bring hither, and ſlay them before me,</hi> Luke 19.27. <hi>And you that were ſometime alienated, and Enemies in your minds by wicked works, Col.</hi> 1.21. Every carnal man in the World is an open and a profeſs'd Enemy againſt God by wicked works; <hi>the works of the Devil, the works
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:59933:81"/> of the Fleſh, that are manifeſt, which are theſe, Adultery, Fornication, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs, Laſciviouſneſs, Idolatry, Witch-craft, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, Variance, Emulations, Wrath, Strife, Seditions, Hereſies, Envyings, Murthers, Drunkenneſs, Revellings, and ſuch like, Gal.</hi> 5.19, 20, 21. Theſe are the works of the fleſh, wicked works; enemies in your minds by wicked works.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They hate the ways and worſhip of God. <hi>The natur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>l man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſs unto him, neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. The carnal World did never like the worſhip of God; Gods worſhip is too holy, and pure for carnal men; it is too ſpiritual, and ſtrict for them; they love the way that is broad, where the moſt go, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.13. though every ſtep they take in it, be to Hell and Damnation. Carnal people do make a profeſſion, but what profeſſion is it? they profeſs that they know God, but in works they deny him, being abominable and diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and unto every good work repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate. They profeſs, but they do not practice; They hear, but they do not do; they learn, but they never come to the knowledg of the Truth; they confeſs
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:59933:82"/> their ſins, but they forſake them not; They acknowledg their iniquities, and yet continue workers of inquity: <hi>When once the maſter of the houſe is riſen up, and hath ſhut to the door, and ye begin to ſtand without, and to knock at the door, ſaying, Lord, Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

See here a carnal worlds profeſſion, it is words all words, and nothing but words. Let us go a little farther, and ſee the worlds worſhip? O! 'tis a brave worſhip, fine, and gawdy, to behold, if you will believe carnal men. But let us ſee what the Scriptures of truth ſay of it. <hi>Bring no more vain oblations; incenſe is an abomination unto, me; the new moons and ſabbaths, the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of aſſemblies I cannot away with, it is iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, even the ſolemn meetings; your new moons, and your appointed feaſts, my ſoul hateth; they are a trouble unto me, I am weary to bear th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>If the World lyes; then it is in wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs. If the World walks; then it is in the broad way, that leads to deſtruction. If the world ſtands; then it is reeling, ſtaggering, ſhaking, and troubled, that it cannot reſt. O what then will it profit a man, to gain a vain world, and loſe his precious Soul? The World makes a ſhew, but it makes no man happy. Can a ſhew, a vain ſhew, make a man really happy? <hi>But this I ſay, Brethren, the time is ſhort, it remaineth, that both they that have wives, be as though they had none: and they that weep, as though they wept not: and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not: and they that buy, as though they poſſeſſed not: and they that uſe this world, as not abuſing it: for the faſhion of this world paſſeth away,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.29, 30, 31. Is not this the faſhion of this World? The Courtiers they thirſt after Honour, the Lawyers they thirſt after Riches, the Tradeſmen they thirſt after gain, the Gallants of the times they thirſt after pleaſures, Perſecutors they thirſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter filthy Lucre. <hi>And I will ſay to my Soul, Soul, thou haſt much goods laid up for many

This was a Crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon fool, a ſcarlet fool, a fool upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord; the mouth of wiſdom called him fool: of this ſort of fools a Saint may find, and ſee every where in the World. Some men would want leſs, if they had leſs; they would enjoy more, if they had not ſo much. The World that looks ſo great now, will appear to be but little, when men come to die; that which now allures them, will then torment them; that which now fills their hearts, will then diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet their minds. <hi>Deliver my Soul from the wicked, which is thy Sword, and from men which are thy hand, O Lord! from men of the World, which have their portion in this life, and whoſe belly thou filleſt with thy hid treaſure, Pſal.</hi> 17.13, 14. If a man look into the World, amongſt all ſorts of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, what can he ſee in it but vanity, and vexation of ſpirit? men labouring for that which cannot ſatisfie, nor ſave them from wrath to come; they are things that periſh; the world is a vain ſhew, and the faſhion of it paſſeth away: <hi>For all Nations before him are as nothing, and they are counted to him leſs than nothing, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> Iſa. 40.17.</p>

               <p>Sixthly, It is a prejudiced world: of the many evils the world lies under, this of prejudice is not the leaſt: when people are poſſeſſed, and filled with prejudice againſt God's holy Ways, his Truth, and Worſhip, and againſt them that love and fear the Lord, it is then a very hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to prevail with them, to hear the Truth, and to receive it. The world hath a great prejudice againſt the people of God.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe they are but a few to the reſt of the world: <hi>You that are but a few,</hi> ſay they, Are you wiſer than all the world? you that are the leaſt in number, are you wiſer than the moſt? Are you wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer than our Fore-fathers were? They did do, as we do now; they did walk, as we walk now; and they did believe, as we do believe now, and we are very certain that they were in the right. <hi>And the King of</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſaid unto</hi> Jehoſhaphat, <hi>There is yet one man, by whom we may enquire of the Lord: but I hate him, for he never propheſied good unto me, but always evil: the ſame is</hi> Macaiah <hi>the Son of</hi> Jimla, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 18.7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>Secondly, Becauſe they are poor. <hi>I will alſo leave in the midſt of thee an afflicted and poor people, and they ſhall truſt in the name of the Lord, Zeph.</hi> 3.12. The true followers of the Lamb in all Ages, have been the poor of this world, but rich in Faith, and heirs of the Kingdom of Heaven; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were ſo, the world deſpiſed them, and were filled with prejudice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. <hi>Then anſwered them the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, Are ye alſo deceived? Have any of the Rulers, or the Phariſees, believed on him? but this people, who knoweth not the Law, are curſed, Joh.</hi> 7.47, 48, 49. The world have always had a great prejudice againſt Truth, where-ever it was found; againſt Truth in the Word of God; againſt Truth in the Worſhip of God; againſt Truth in the Ways of God; againſt Truth in the People of God; againſt Truth in the Providences of God: this is that the world knoweth not; this is that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not receive; this is that it cannot bear; therefore the people of the world are fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with prejudice againſt Truth, as they have been in all times, and in all Ages paſt; that is to ſay,

               <p n="1">1. The Morning Truth is that love, light, mercy, and grace, which Almighty God hath been pleas'd to bring forth, and make manifeſt to his people, in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations of Times, and in the Ages of the World, for the good of them that did love, and fear him. When the fulneſs of time, was come, that the Children of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> were to be brought out of the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and to go in and poſſeſs that good Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which the Lord had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd to give them for an inheritance, this was then the Morning truth, <hi>To believe the Lord their God, and to follow him fully;</hi> but they were filled with prejudice againſt it. <hi>And wherefore hath the Lord brought us unto this Land, to fall by the Sword, that our Wives and our Children ſhould be a prey! were it not better for us to return into</hi> Egypt! <hi>And they ſaid one to another, Let us make a Captain, and let us return into</hi> Egypt, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.3, 4. But when they had poſſeſſed the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and had divided the Land by Lot, the Morning truth was then, <hi>To keep Gods Commandments, and to obſerve his Statutes and Judgments, and to keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:59933:88"/> from Idols and from all Idolatry, but they were filled with prejudice againſt it, and rebelled againſt the Lord their God, and built them high places, and did ſet up Images, and Groves on every Hill, and under every green Tree,</hi> 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 14.23. And when they ſlew the Beaſts for ſacrifice, that they might offer up their blood, they were then to look through all the ſacrifices, and through the blood, to the blood of Jeſus, <hi>For if the blood of Bulls, and of Goats, and the aſhes of an Heifer ſprinkling the unclean, ſanctifieth to the purifying of the Fleſh: how much more ſhall the blood of Chriſt? Who through the eternal ſpirit offered himſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpot to God, Heb.</hi> 9.13, 14. Then the morning truth was to believe the Prophets, which ſhewed of the coming of the Juſt one, but they were filled with prejudice againſt it. <hi>Which of the Prophets have not your fathers perſecuted? And they have ſlain them, which ſhewed before of the coming of the Juſt one, of whom ye have been now the betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and murderers, Acts</hi> 7.52. And in the days of our Saviour, when he was on the Earth, and preached Peace to them, and wrought many Miracles amongſt them, <hi>&amp; went up and down doing good;</hi> this was then the morning truth, <hi>To believe in him. Neither is there ſalvation in any other, for there is none

But they were filled with prejudice againſt it. <hi>Then Jeſus ſaid unto the chief Prieſts, and Captains of the Temple, and the elders which were come to him, Be ye come out as againſt a Thief, with Swords and Staves? When I was daily with you in the Temple, ye ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forth no Hands againſt me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkneſs, Luke</hi> 22.52, 53. And after he was riſen from the dead, and had ſhewed himſelf ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times to his Diſciples, and that all pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was given to him both in Heaven and in Earth; then this was the morning truth; <hi>Go ye therefore and teach all Nations, baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, &amp; of the Holy Ghoſt, teaching them to obſerve all things whatſoever I have command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you, Mat.</hi> 28.19, 20.

And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold ye have filled</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>with your Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and intend to bring this mans Blood upon us,</hi> Acts 5.27, 28. <hi>But when believers were added unto the Lord, multitudes both of Men and Women; then the morning truth was

And by him all that believe are Juſtified from all things, from which ye could not be Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the law of</hi> Moſes, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.39. but they were filled with prejudice againſt it. <hi>For as much as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, ſubverting your ſouls, ſaying, Ye muſt be circumciſed, and keep the Law, to whom we gave no ſuch commandment, Acts</hi> 15.24. And this is the morning truth now, to worſhip the ever living God in ſpirit, and in truth; and to wait for his Son Chriſt Jeſus from Heaven, and for the rich anointing of the ſpirit, and the fulfilling of his word, and the accompliſhment of the prophecies, and the perfecting of his work, and the fini<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. The naked truth, as it ſtands in the ſcriptures of truth, which was delivered to the Saints of God, by the Prophets, and by the holy Apoſtles, and by our Lord Jeſus. <hi>For whatſoever things were written afore-time, were written for our learning, that we through patience, and comfort of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures might have hope,</hi> Rom. 15.4. <hi>God
<pb facs="tcp:59933:90"/> who at ſundry times and in divers manners ſpake in time paſt unto the Fathers by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, hath in theſe laſt days ſpoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom alſo he made the Worlds,</hi> Heb. 1.1, 2. <hi>To the law and to the Teſtimony, if they ſpeak not according to this word, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is no light in them, Iſa.</hi> 8.20. But there were falſe Prophets alſo among the People, even as there ſhall be falſe teachers among you, <hi>who privily ſhall bring in damnable hereſies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themſelves ſwift deſtruction,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1. The World is fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with prejudice againſt the naked truth, a naked world cannot endure the naked truth. Men add to the worſhip of God, and their fear towards God is taught by the precepts of men, they dreſs truth with modes and faſhions, and mix it with their inventions, and darken it with their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verings; but when truth is naked it ſhines, and it is beautiful, and glorious; it arms a man, and makes him as bold as a Lion, when he is girt about with truth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The whole truth. <hi>For I have not ſhunned to declare unto you all the counſel of God, Acts</hi> 20.27. ſome part of truth a man may believe, and own, and profeſs in any part of <hi>Europe;</hi> and this he may do
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:59933:90"/> without giving offence to any man, but the whole truth men will not hear, nor bear, nor receive, for they are filled with prejudice againſt it, and condemn it, and cry it down, and oppoſe it with all their might. <hi>This did the</hi> Phariſees. <hi>And ſome of the</hi> Phariſees <hi>which were with him, heard theſe words, and ſaid unto him, Are we blind alſo? Jeſus ſaid unto them, If ye were blind, ye ſhould have no ſin; but now ye ſay, We ſee, therefore your ſin remaineth, John</hi> 9.40, 41. Men may hold ſome truths, and yet be the Enemies of truth. They may profeſs ſome truths, and yet deſtroy their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours for the truths ſake.

               <p n="1">1. God is the Object that all his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple look unto, <hi>Their eyes are unto him,</hi> and the deſire of their Souls is unto his name, and to the remembrance of him. <hi>Look un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, and be ye ſaved, all the ends of the earth: for I am God, and there is none elſe, Iſa.</hi> 45.22. When we come to the Throne of his Grace, and caſt our ſelves down at his Feet, by Prayer and Supplication, God is that glorious Object we pray unto, and by Faith, behold him, and take hold of his ſtrength, and wreſtle with him for the obtaining of all Spiritual Bleſſings in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
               <p>This is that the Saints of God have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:59933:94"/> done, and this is that the Scriptures of truth teach us to do, that when we pray, the Lord God ſhould be the Object of our Prayers. Prayer is a great part of Gods worſhip, and of all parts this is the moſt Spiritual. Now they that have other Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects when they pray, do but deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and rob God of his honour, in giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that glory to graven Images, which is only due to God Almighty. <hi>But in every thing by prayer and ſupplication, with thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, let your requeſts be made known unto God, Phil.</hi> 4.6.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Spirit is the Advocate. <hi>Likewiſe the Spirit alſo helpeth our infirmities: For we know not what we ſhould pray for as we ought, but the ſpirit it ſelf maketh interceſſion for us with greanings which cannot be uttered. And be that ſearcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the ſpirit, becauſe he maketh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion for the Saints, according to the will of God,</hi> Rom. 8.26, 27. <hi>But God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed them unto us by his ſpirit: for the ſpirit ſearcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.10. <hi>For through him we both have an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>cceſs by one ſpirit unto the Father, Eph.</hi> 2.18. The holy Spirit maketh inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, and is an Advocate for man with God, and this makes a Saint a Conqueror; for the Spirit of God that is in him ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaileth
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:59933:95"/> with God for him, that whatſoever he asketh in Faith, according to the will of God, it is given to him. <hi>For ye have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the ſpirit of Adoption whereby we cry, Abba, Father, Rom.</hi> 8.15.</p>
               <p>Now the Spirit is a double Advocate, it is an Advocate for men with God, and it is an Advocate for God with men. The firſt of theſe I have already ſhewed you; and this will lead me to the ſecond. <hi>And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himſelf by Jeſus Chriſt, and hath given to us the miniſtry of reconciliation, to wit, that God was in Chriſt, reconciling the world unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, not imputing their treſpaſſes unto them, and hath committed unto us the word of reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. Now then we are Ambaſſadors for Chriſt, as though God did beſeech you by us, we pray you in Chriſts ſtead, be ye reconciled unto God,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.18, 19, 20. By this you may ſee how God beſeecheth men to be reconciled unto him; and this he doth by the Spirit in the Miniſtry of the Word. The holy Spirit ſtrives with men, but they reſiſt the ſtrivings of it. <hi>And the Lord ſaid, My ſpirit ſhall not always ſtrive with man,</hi> Gen. 6.3. <hi>Ye ſtiff-necked, and uncircumciſed in heart and ears, ye do always reſiſt the holy Ghoſt: as your fathers did, ſo do ye, Acts</hi> 7.51.

               <p>Theſe make men have an implacable hatred to all that is good. When men are governed by theſe, they imploy their rage and fury againſt the faithful. With the greater part of Mankind, theſe are ſo pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful that nothing but the mighty power of God is able to overcome them; and to reſcue men from their force. It will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a meaſure of the extraordinary graces of Gods Spirit to be poured out. And this is that good work, which the Lord works in the Souls of men, by his holy Spirit.

He makes them new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and leads them into the paths of truth and righteouſneſs. This is a victory, <hi>and this victory overcometh the world, even our faith,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.4. <hi>And when he is come, he will reprove the world of ſin, &amp; of righteouſneſs, &amp; of judgment.

This changeth mens Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures into a Lamb-like Spirit, as the Prophet ſpeaketh. <q>The Wolf alſo ſhall dwell with the Lamb, and the Leopard ſhall lye down with the Kid;
<pb facs="tcp:59933:97"/> and the Calf, and the young Lion, and the Fatling together, and a little Child ſhall lead them. And the Cow and the Bear ſhall feed, their young ones ſhall lye down together, and the Lion ſhall eat Straw like the Oxe. And the ſuckling Child ſhall play on the hole of the Aſp, and the weaned Child ſhall put his hand on the Cockatrice den; they ſhall not hurt nor deſtroy in all my holy moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain: for the Earth ſhall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the Waters cover the Sea, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.6, 7, 8, 9.</q> When ſin ſhall be done away, and ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity ſhall be finiſhed, when the Tribes of the Earth ſhall be rent from the power of darkneſs; and the everlaſting Goſpel ſhall be preach'd to all nations under Heaven, then none ſhall hurt and deſtroy in all thy holy mountain.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Let no man deceive you by any means, for that day ſhall not come, except there come a falling away firſt, and that man of ſin be revealed, the ſon of perdition, who oppoſeth and exalteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf above all that is called God, or that is worſhiped, ſo that he, as God, ſitteth in the Temple of God, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf that he is God. Remember ye not, that when I was yet with you, I told you theſe things? And now ye know what with-holdeth, that he might be revealed in his time. For the Myſtery of Iniquity doth already work, only he who now letteth, will lett, until he be taken out of the way. And then ſhall that wicked be revealed, whom the Lord ſhall conſume with the Spirit of his Mouth, and ſhall deſtroy with the brightneſs of his coming, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.3, to 8.</q> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> having the Spirit of God, did in that Spirit tell theſe <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> what ſhould come to paſs hereafter.</p>

               <p>Sixthly, How the Lord would puniſh them, and plague them for their Apoſtacy; <q>And for this cauſe God ſhall ſend them ſtrong deluſions, that they ſhould believe a lie, that they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleaſure in unrighteouſneſs, <hi>v.</hi> 11, 12.</q>

                  </gap> things that were to be, as God had purpoſed and determined accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his own Counſel and Will; and theſe things knoweth no man till Providence brings them forth. <q>But of that day and that hour knoweth no man no not the Angels which are in Heaven neither the Son, but the Father, <hi>Mark</hi> 13.32. And he ſaid unto them. It is not for you to know the Times and the Seaſons, which the Father hath put in his own power, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.7.</q> Surely, the Angels that are in Heaven know more than men that are on the Earth! and yet you ſee they did not know of that
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:59933:101"/> day nor hour; nor the Son, as he was man, but the Father.</p>
               <p>And after our Lord Jeſus was riſen from the dead the Apoſtles asked of him, ſaying, <q>Lord wilt thou at this time reſtore again the Kingdom to <hi>Iſrael?</hi>
                  </q> He then ſoon anſwered them, <q>It is not for you to know the Times or Seaſons, which the Father hath put in his own power. No man knoweth what ſhall be on the morrow, what a day may bring forth, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.14.</q> No man can ſay, This ſhall be, or that ſhall be, in this time, or at that time. He can go no further than conjectures and imaginations, which have led men into error and confuſion, and into great miſtakes. This is very plain, that men do not know what ſhall befal them, and others, the next hour. <q>And I ſaw when the Lamb opened one of the Seals, I heard as it were the noiſe of thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and I ſaw, and behold, a white Horſe, and he that ſate on him had a Bow, and a Crown was given unto him, and he went forth Conquering, and to Conquer. And when he had opened the ſecond Seal, there went out another Horſe that was red: And power was given to him that ſate thereon, to take peace from the Earth, and that they ſhould kill one another: And there was given unto him a great Sword. And when he had open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the third Seal, I beheld, and lo, a black Horſe, and he that ſate on him had a pair of Ballances in his Hand. And I heard a voice in the midſt of the four Beaſts, ſaying, A meaſure of Wheat for a penny, and three meaſures of Barley for a penny, and ſee thou hurt not the Oyl and the Wine. And when he had opened the fourth Seal, I looked, and behold, a pale Horſe, and his name that ſate on him was Death; and Hell followed with him: And power was given unto them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the fourth part of the Earth, to kill with Sword, and with Hunger, and with Death, and
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:59933:101"/> with the Beaſts of the Earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Rev. 6.1, to 8.</q>
               </p>
               <p>By this you may ſee things did not appear until the Seals were opened! but as ſoon as the Lamb had opened any of the Seals, Providence brought forth the things that did appear to the ſight and view of men: Then that came to be known, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was unknown: When he had opened the firſt Seal. <q>I ſaw and behold a white Horſe, and he that ſate on him had a Bow, and a Crown was given unto him, and he went forth Conquering, and to Conquer.</q> This was the Preaching of the Everlaſting Goſpel; Chriſt Jeſus in the Miniſtry of the Word, conquering and overcoming rebellious Sinners; working in them by his Word and Spirit, Life and Light, Love and Grace, Holineſs and Truth, and filling them with all Spiritual Bleſſings; and being changed into the ſame Image, from Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord: The Preaching of this Goſpel did then raiſe a great Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult, and made the World to Arm, and put them into a great Rage; and men were filled with Enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Prejudice againſt the Truth: then they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted, and took counſel together how they might deſtroy Gods Faithful Servants, which keep the Commandments of God, and the Teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt; and the Perſecutors in that day, did ſlay and deſtroy many thouſands of Gods dear Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. <q>And when he had opened the fifth Seal, I ſaw under the Altar the Souls of them that were ſlain for the Word of God, and for the Teſtimony which they held. And they cryed with a loud voice, ſaying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, doſt thou not judge and avenge our Blood on them that dwell on the Earth, <hi>verſe</hi> 9, 10.</q> Then the Lord puniſh'd the Inhabitants of the Earth, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny heavy and ſore Judgments, War and Peſtilence, and Famine, and Death; as appears by the opening of the other Seals. Thus it was then, and ſo it hath
<pb facs="tcp:59933:102"/> been ever ſince. Now all the things that Providence hath brought forth at any time, hath not overthrown the Faith of the Goſpel, nor ſwallowed up the true Church; neither hath it deſtroyed Gods truth from amongſt men! neither hath it thrown down that Spiritual worſhip which God hath ſet up, but all the things that Providence hath brought forth at any time, have all workt together for the good of Gods people.

                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>en as of things that are made, that thoſe things which cannot
<pb facs="tcp:59933:102"/> be ſhaken, may remain, <hi>Hebrews</hi> 12.26, 27.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, By the ſigns of Providence. <q>O ye Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, ye can diſcern the Face of the Sky, but ye cannot diſcern the Signs of the Times! A Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Adulterous Generation ſeeketh after a Sign, and there ſhall no Sign be given unto it, but the Sign of the Prophet <hi>Jonas.</hi> And he left them, and departed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.3, 4.</q> By this you ſee Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence hath a Voice, and a Sign; the Voice of the Times, and the Signs of the Times. And both theſe ſhew Knowledge, and give Underſtanding to Men that duly mind and obſerve them. Every Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is not a Trumpet; but the mighty Things which Providence ſometimes brings forth are as a Trumpet! the ſound thereof goes unto the ends of the Earth. Whatſoever things Providence brings forth, they ſhall work together for the good of the Church. <q>For the Eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole Earth, to ſhew himſelf ſtrong in the behalf of them, whoſe Heart is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect towards him, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.9.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, From the people of God. <q>They are all labourers together with God, and workers together with him for the good of the Church. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.9.</q> By Faith, by Prayer, by Hope, by Holy Deſires, and by all Good Endeavours; that they may further the Churches Peace, and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and enlarge her Borders; and for this end God hath given Gifts unto Men. But unto every one of us is given Grace, according to the meaſure of the Gift of Chriſt, <q>Wherefore he ſaith, when he aſcended up on high, he led Captivity Captive, and gave Gifts unto Men. Now that he aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, what is it but that he alſo deſcended firſt into the lower parts of the Earth? He that deſcended, is the ſame alſo that aſcended up far above all Heavens, that he might fill all things. And he gave ſome, Apoſtles: and ſome, Prophets: and
<pb facs="tcp:59933:103"/> ſome, Evangeliſts: and ſome Paſtors and Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Miniſtry, for the edifying of the Body of Chriſt: till we all come in the unity of the Faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect Man, unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſs of Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.7, to 13. Whether <hi>Paul,</hi> or <hi>Apollo,</hi> or <hi>Cephas,</hi> or the World, or Life, or Death, or things Preſent, or things to Come, all are yours; and ye are Chriſts, and Chriſt is Gods, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.22, 23.</q>
               </p>
               <p>By this it appears, that the Gifts and Parts, and Abilities, that Miniſters have, are given to them of God! not to gain filthy Lucre, but to gain Souls, that they might gather them unto Chriſt Jeſus. They are Builders, but not to Build up themſelves in worldly Wealth; but to Build up the Church of God, to perfect the Saints; they have Talents given them, but for what end? For the work of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, for the edifying the Body of Chriſt; and for this end God gives grace unto men. <hi>Unto me, who am leſs than the leaſt of all Saints, is this grace given, that I ſhould preach among the Gentiles the unſearchable riches of Chriſt, Eph.</hi> 3.8. Chriſts Miniſters have heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Treaſures in them, that they may make many rich, Preaching to others the unſearchable riches of Chriſt; and in this way will Chriſt Jeſus be with his Church to the end of the World, raiſing up faithful Witneſſes in all Ages, and filling them with his holy Spirit, that rich Anointing which is from above, that they may be able Miniſters, not only of the Letter, but of the Spirit, and this ſupply the Church will always have to the end of the World; every Saint that is on the Earth is in Arms, upon Duty and Exerciſe, for the good of the Church; every Saint is a Soldier under Chriſt Jeſus the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of our Salvation, fighting under him againſt the Devil and the World, againſt Sin and Luſt, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb facs="tcp:59933:103"/> Principalities and Powers, againſt the Rulers of the darkneſs of this World, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.12. Every Saint is a petitioner, and a wreſtler with God, by prayer and ſupplication, for the peace and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Church. Every Saint is a labourer and a worker together with God, that Gods glory may be advanced, and his holy name lifted up in the Earth, that his ways may be made known to all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and his ſaving health to all people; that the work of God may go on and proſper in theſe Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which the Lord hath begun, and hath been carrying on theſe many years; that <hi>Babylon</hi> may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a deſolation and the hiſſing and loathing of all Nations, and the <hi>Zion</hi> of God may become the joy and praiſe of the whole Earth; and this is the Faith and Hope, and Deſires of all Gods people.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, From the Enemies of God: <hi>Surely there is no enchantment againſt</hi> Jacob, <hi>neither is there any divination againſt</hi> Iſrael: <hi>according to this time it ſhall be ſaid of</hi> Jacob, <hi>and of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>what hath God wrought,</hi> Numb. 23.23. <hi>The</hi> Phariſees <hi>therefore ſaid among themſelves, Perceive ye how ye prevail no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing! behold, the world is gone after him,</hi> John 12.19. <hi>And now I ſay unto you, Refrain from theſe men, and let them alone; for if this counſel, or this work be of men, it will come to nought: but if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it, leſt haply ye be found even to fight againſt God, Acts</hi> 5.38, 39. We have here a Cloud of Witneſſes, the Teſtimonies of good men, that the True Church ſhall ſtand for ever; and here are alſo the ſayings of bad men, and it is agreed on all hands, <hi>That the Church of Chriſt cannot be deſtroyed, but it ſhall ſtand for ever.</hi> Can men pull out the Rocks that are in the Sea with their Teeth? Can men blow away the Mountains of the Earth with their Breath? Can men reach up to Heaven with their Hands? Can men dry up the great and wide Sea, where Ships go from Nation to
<pb facs="tcp:59933:104"/> Nation? Can men draw a Curtain before the Sun, that it ſhall not ſhine on the Earth? Can men Seal up the Wind that it ſhall not blow where it liſteth? Alas, this will be ſoon granted by all, that men, the greateſt of men cannot do any of theſe things; ſurely then men cannot <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
